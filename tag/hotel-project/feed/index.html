										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hotel Management Company is a firm that is determined to manage all of the daily tasks of a hotel. From making sure that the guest rooms look right to keep an eye on the daily profits, a hotel management company makes sure that everything is running smoothly.</p>
<p>Most of the people around us are unaware of the fact that the well-known hotels around the globe hire professional hotel management companies to run their business. However, the question arises, how can one believe in a particular hotel management company? For this purpose, the IHCS hotel consulting company is always ready to help independent hotel owners or investors. IHCS is the solution to all of your worries and is always available to provide you the best solutions for selecting your dream hotel management company. We have staff with years of practical experience to provide the best to our customers.</p>
<p>The importance of having the right hotel management company can never be denied, and while thinking about the best, no one can deny the name of IHCS. Let us see in detail that what are the criteria and benefits one can get by the search and selection for the right hotel management company.</p>
<p><b>IHCS guide on selecting the right hotel management company</b></p>
<p>According to our experts, the following are the guidelines that one must focus on selecting the right hotel management company:</p>
<p><b>Maintain a competitive environment</b></p>
<p>Proprietors frequently fall for the principal management company they meet. They get welcome to visit the company&#8217;s most pleasant property, remain in a beautiful suite, appreciate a decent supper with the chiefs of the company, and, then before they know it, they feel submitted. Shockingly, management organizations are not equivalent, and management contract terms can change drastically. Establishing a serious climate from the beginning will compel the director to arrange an ideal arrangement and result in a more positive result for the proprietor. The most widely recognized technique to establish a competition is through the proposal process.</p>
<p><b>Get help from the right advisor</b></p>
<p>Hotels are working organizations, and the connection between proprietor and administrator is not a simple subject to handle. Most management organizations have broad experience in management arrangements and use both in-house and outside direction. Proprietorship ought to be correspondingly spoken to by specialists. All proprietors ought to be spoken to by specialists that have practical experience in hotel management arrangements.</p>
<p>Proprietors or owners with restricted involvement with hotel management choice additionally should enlist an accomplished hotel resource director to help them through the cycle and to work with management on a continuous premise to boost the estimation of the hotel. In the selection process of management, the advisor will assist the owners with clarifying objectives and, subsequently, give suggestions with respect to the best management company for the hotel.</p>
<p><b>Explain your objectives</b></p>
<p>Maximizing the estimation is ordinarily the owner&#8217;s essential objective and is the reason for most choices. However, boosting isn&#8217;t as basic as it appears. An engineer constructing a full-administration hotel in a high boundary to-section metropolitan market may be best served by keeping the hotel autonomous. However, additionally, it could be a genuinely dangerous technique. Different hotel owners are not propelled by the productivity of their hotels yet are more worried about the effect of the hotel on other factors. For instance, schools and colleges regularly are more worried about securing their relationship with the network and their image picture than with the main concern benefit. Whatever the objective, understanding the objectives is a significant factor to consider while choosing a management company.</p>
<p><b>Understand your hotel</b></p>
<p>Each hotel is special. Many offer similar features, yet none are equivalent. Hotels are not just a component of their room check and actual item; they likewise are characterized by their area, the interest on the lookout, and their opposition. Sharp owners will have a careful comprehension of their hotel whether or not it&#8217;s a current property or new development. Moreover, ownership ought to have a decent comprehension of the hotel&#8217;s capital requirements and extended money related execution. In conclusion, understanding the hotel&#8217;s attractive quality to administrators is necessary.</p>
<p>After the hotel owners have focused on all of the four above-mentioned factors, the next step is to hire a company that seems suitable for their business based on the results of these factors prescribed by IHCS.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Right? But hold for a sec. Are you done formulating standard operating procedures (SOPs) for this hotel project? Did you blurt out, no? Then you need to do it right now before any further delay. SOP is the backbone of a hotel&#8217;s success. However, the central aspect here is not only formulating these SOP, but real struggle begins when you need to come up with RIGHT SOPs according to the needs of your hotel or resort. Because these three words (Standard Operating Procedure) can make or break a hotel.</p>
<h2>What Is Standard Operating Procedure?</h2>
<p>If you are not so sure about these words. Allow us to explain it to you. Standard Operating procedures are a shared set of instructions that a company has in place to carry out any operation efficiently, safely, and smoothly. These SOPs implies to everyone independent of who is working at that moment. These SOPs are just like a recipe whose target is the perfect result without caring about when and who is making this dish.</p>
<h2>Importance Of SOPs In A Hotel Project</h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s dive deep into the importance of having SOPs in the pre-opening phase of a hotel.</p>
<h3>Consistency:</h3>
<p>Establishing a better structure in your hotel business can dramatically reduce costs and boosts productivity. SOPs provide business consistency in the way an individual carries out a specific</p>
<p>activity or task. SOPs ensure that processes continue uninterrupted and are completed on a regular schedule. A more promising standard operating procedure can also rectify the errors caused by facility damage, equipment failure or absence, leave of staff, etc.</p>
<h3>SOPs Simplify Performance Management:</h3>
<p>It makes ranking and grading procedures much easier for managers. Using the framework of SOPs, responsible authorities can make assessments of individual performance. When all workers follow the same processes, it is an easy matter to compare and measure them against the same standards. On the other hand, SOPs also protects employees from uncertainty by guiding them precisely what is expected from them. And how they can plan their work schedules to meet their goals efficiently within a suitable time frame.</p>
<h3>Protects You From Knowledge Loss:</h3>
<p>SOPs protects your expected risk of knowledge loss by keeping proper documentation of your hotel project. If your business doesn&#8217;t have SOPs, it directly means no manual record to run your hotel operation efficiently, which can be disastrous. Proper documentation will also enable you to keep check and balance on your employee&#8217;s performance and guests’ feedback.</p>
<h3>Quality Control:</h3>
<p>Everyone launches a business with the hope of seeing his business as a successful top-notch business ever in his head, and you are not an exception. And If you want to make this dream come true, the first and foremost rule is to maintain a high standard of quality. And SOPs can do this much-complicated task efficiently for your hotel. First formulating and then meticulously following SOPs guarantee that your service is designed according to the expectations of your customers. Maintaining a five-star structure and procedure will give them a feeling that you are valuing their money. In this way, your faultlessly developed SOPs can make your investment in the hotel project the best investment you ever did.</p>
<h3>Saves Your Time:</h3>
<p>SOPs can become responsible for your sigh of relief because once you are done formulating the right, adequate SOPs for your hotel. You can allow your SOPs to take charge of your system. Sitting down and taking some time to develop an SOP for every little procedure sounds chaotic at first, but once you are done with it, it can save your energy and time later to be utilized in other stuff. In this way, you can also look into other matters and let SOPs do their job. In short, taking enough time to develop SOPs in the pre-opening phase of your resort or hotel is a one-time investment that keeps giving you fruitful results later.</p>
<h2>Summary</h2>
<p>Hence proved that having a standard operating procedure before opening a new hotel is worth every struggle. And if your strategies and SOPs formation are in the right hands, they can make your business shine in no time. So if you want to make your business successful and require top-notch services within your hotel business, contact <a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IHCS Consulting Services</a> , and request your free consultation today.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <strong>hotel consultant</strong> is a professional that can provide a new approach to our hotel, helping us to enhance certain aspects related to the team or to certain aspects of the organisation as a whole.</p>
<p>We will analyse this issue in depth so that you can learn about their duties in detail.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">What can the presence of a hotel consultant bring to us?</h2>
<p><strong>Capturing customers: </strong>They will be in charge of implementing different strategies that will help us to capture customers, as well as retain them. They will also segment the market in order to be able to identify the most predisposed profile to visit our complex.</p>
<p><strong>Increased profitability: </strong>They will also study any type of aspect that is related to the hotel&#8217;s viability; including the management of payments, prices of services, appropriate hiring of staff, payment of taxes&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Positioning the brand on the Internet: </strong>The Internet is an important resource that will help the world to learn more about our hotel. For example, should we have a hotel in Lanzarote, we can position our page with the appropriate terms so that, when a customer wants to stay in that place, we will appear in the first positions. Given the importance of this aspect, the <strong>hotel consultant</strong> will have the appropriate knowledge needed to extend the brand throughout the network.</p>
<h3>What does a hotel consultant bring to a hotel?</h3>
<p>In addition to all the aspects we have mentioned in the previous section, we will now see more specifically how having a hotel consultant can benefit us.</p>
<h4>Identifies the technology that most suits the business</h4>
<p>Computerisation is key in hotels; a suitable software must be used to manage employee payrolls, customer details, payments, supplier agreements, as well as any other related aspect.</p>
<p>As there is a high quantity of hotel software existing on the market, choosing the most suitable one for us is not an easy task; a <strong>hotel consultant</strong> will have the appropriate knowledge, based on the type of hotel and its needs, to choose the most suitable technology.</p>
<h4>Adaptation to the market</h4>
<p>The truth is that the hotel sector is evolving at a very progressive rate, and it is very possible that your competition has overtaken you. Knowing how to go one step ahead will help us attract customers and strengthen the business.</p>
<p>A hotel consultant will be in tune with the latest changes; in this way, you can adapt to the market to achieve the best results.</p>
<h4>Better time management</h4>
<p>The vast majority of hotels waste time doing some manual tasks that could be automated. A <strong>hotel consultant</strong> will have the right tools to automate different processes; this will not only save time, it will also save money.</p>
<p>For all of these reasons, hiring a hotel consultant may be the best decision of your life, something that really will keep the business afloat or simply improve profits.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Productivity is a factor that must be controlled in any business at all times and is that if a business ceases to be productive or we do something to turn the situation around, it will not fail to fail.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hotel sector is working with increasingly tighter margins, and more aggressive competition is trying to get the better of us. That&#8217;s why it is important to squeeze the most out of resources and try to make more from less.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Can we improve the productivity of our team?</h2>
<p><strong>Before we look to staff to improve hotel productivity, we need to ask ourselves the following questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have we defined what tasks each employee should complete on their shift? What tasks does each department have? Have we measured how long these tasks take and how much they cost?</li>
<li>Do we have the advanced management tools we need to control our business&#8217; activity?</li>
<li>Do we know what the business&#8217; &#8216;fat&#8217; is?</li>
</ul>
<p>By &#8216;fat&#8217; we mean the activities or behaviours that could slow staff down when completing their tasks, generating idle periods of time, bottlenecks, and repetitive tasks. In other words, it is the time that an employee does not have a specific task to do and spends it doing unproductive activities.</p>
<h3>Improving the hotel productivity by better managing shifts and flexibility</h3>
<p>Answering these questions is the first step you need to take before assessing if your planning is stable or if you should modify anything.</p>
<p>You need to determine <strong>the number of bookings you have</strong> and get an idea of the influx; these figures will indicate how many staff members you need on the team, and whether to include more or fewer shifts.</p>
<p>When we talk about flexibility, we&#8217;re referring to the dynamism related to assigning shifts and working hours to hotel employees, in accordance with the tasks foreseen.</p>
<p>The hotel does not have the solvency needed to always bear the same costs when it comes to paying staff wages. At times when there is more work, the costs associated with keeping staff are incredibly high.</p>
<p>To avoid this, <strong>flexi-time</strong> can be employed, where a given number of work hours are placed in a &#8216;bank&#8217; for busier periods, and employees are not required to work during quieter times. This &#8216;<strong>bank</strong>&#8216; helps keep a control, trying to ensure that the employee is productive during the period of time that they are contracted, paying them extra hours where necessary.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important that the hotel works with advanced management tools to control everything mentioned above and assign tasks to employees, manage incidents and special working hours, etc.</p>
<p>With these key factors, our <strong>hotel productivity</strong> is improved thanks <a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/blog/staff-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>to good staff management</strong></a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you want your hotel to be full all year round, you can&#8217;t sit back twiddling your thumbs. A factor that we should examine is our staff&#8217;s qualifications, i.e. if employees have the right training, the customer will receive the service they are looking for, improving their overall experience and making it more likely that they are going to rely on our services again and speak well of our business.</p>
<p>These are just some of the reasons why we should invest in staff training.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Why should you do staff training?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Experience</strong></h3>
<p>Satisfying customers is not enough anymore; we need to make them love us. If the hotel only thinks about being OK, and just passing the mark, we probably won&#8217;t get a negative review, but we won&#8217;t be getting a positive one either!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be honest, the customer probably won&#8217;t even remember your hotel.</p>
<p>You need to remember that they have probably visited several hotels over the year and if you want to stand out, it&#8217;s only logical that your employees need to have been trained correctly to improve the customer experience.</p>
<h3><strong>Information</strong></h3>
<p>So they know what the customer is asking for at all times, your employees need to be able to understand them. That&#8217;s where knowing more languages is always better when it comes to the &#8220;tourism&#8221; sector.</p>
<h3><strong>Managing bad reviews</strong></h3>
<p>A bad review can ruin your business. If we know the client&#8217;s exact problem, we can act on it immediately, stopping things from getting any worse.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why you should train your employs with protocols, sales techniques, event management, customer service, loyalty strategies and communication skills, environmental awareness, etc.</p>
<p>Thanks to this training, the worker will be able to manage strategies that improve the hotel&#8217;s reputation or any crisis that it may be faced with.</p>
<p>If the employee does not know how to respond to a complicated situation, this could spoil everything for the hotel.</p>
<h3><strong>Online channels</strong></h3>
<p>Given the number of offers that there are in the hotel sector, any added bonus is key to position yourself above your competitors. Having affordable packages is not enough, as we now need to do everything possible to promote them properly.</p>
<p>If you train your staff in online marketing, and other promotional techniques, your investment in advertising will be in the best hands.</p>
<h3><strong>The road to success</strong></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that a poorly managed company is set for failure. A hotel director must know about administration and business management among other areas and must retrain constantly given that this sector is always changing.</p>
<p>If we invest in training our employs, it makes it a lot easier for all of us to achieve the objectives that we set.</p>
<p>These are all the reasons why training staff is key, not just in the hotel industry, but for any type of business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Hotel communication: tips for improving it</h2>
<h3>Make your vision known</h3>
<p>In order to avoid confusion among the different employees, it will be crucial for each member of staff to know the mission and vision of the company. They must know both the short and long-term goals.</p>
<p>This will help them to be motivated, so they will feel more involved with the hotel.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>It is worth remembering that communication is a type of skill that must be learned. If you realise that there are significant problems with communication at your hotel, you should start thinking of offering training courses to the staff, so that they can overcome these barriers that could end with the business going bankrupt.</p>
<h3>Launch strategies that encourage teamwork</h3>
<p>Experts say that a good way of breaking the communication barriers is to launch initiatives to encourage our employees to work as a team. For example, we can create certain out-of-office events to improve trust among the employees and allow them to form close relationships.</p>
<h3>Constantly organise meetings</h3>
<p>In order to achieve an effective communication system at the company, this must be maintained regularly. This is why you should organise at least one meeting per week. The idea is for both yourself and your employees to get up-to-date with what is happening at the hotel.</p>
<p>We must take advantage of this moment to listen to any complaints and suggestions that they wish to convey to us.</p>
<h3>Reaction</h3>
<p>All companies have communication problems at any given time; either due to the inefficiency of management, incompetent employees or for any other reason. The biggest companies have learned to act on any abnormal sign, preventing it from going any further.</p>
<p>If you are prepared for what may happen and take the appropriate measures before everything gets worse, you will save the situation.</p>
<p>These strategies are key for improving communication at a hotel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Adult only</em></strong> hotels have become a global trend. They emerged in Spain at the end of the last decade, with the feature of being designed so that we can enjoy time with our partner, to find tranquillity, luxury and pure relaxation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Adult only hotels: the key feature</h3>
<p>According to statistics, the number of bookings at this type of accommodation have multiplied 3 times in recent years; therefore, we are talking about a tourism that interests people. This explains why the number of hotels dedicated to this sector have increased in such a way.</p>
<p>These hotels began to establish themselves on the market throughout the 70s, a time when &#8220;honeymoon&#8221; holidays reached their highest point.</p>
<p>For example, in the Caribbean there are some hotels with areas specially designed for adults, or those that only allow adults to stay. In Europe we can find these in countries such as Spain and Croatia; and in Asia, in Bali. Other hotel chains also offer the possibility to improve this adult only service by offering butlers, swimming pools and private beaches, double jacuzzis in the bedrooms, as well as exclusive access to VIP areas.</p>
<h3>All inclusive luxury: an option to make customers feel at home</h3>
<p>This option has been designed so that the customer has everything they are looking for with no restrictions; to feel as comfortable as they are at home, but with the same benefits offered to them by the resort.</p>
<p>The people who book these hotels are aged between 30 and 50 years; moreover, their family income is calculated to be approximately above €60,000.</p>
<p>Thus, unlike what is achieved at other hotels, the goal is not only to provide stays to the user, but also a customised experience. The customer who hires this service wants to customise it as they please; in doing so, the likelihood that they return will be much higher.</p>
<p>It is calculated that, to date, there are more than 140 hotels with an <strong><em>Adults Only</em></strong><em> </em>option throughout the market; of these, 74 are located in the Balearic Islands, another 30 in the Canary Islands and 20 in Mainland Spain. It is estimated that there will be a total of more than 600 establishments across the world. The vast majority of them are rather small, with facilities that do not suit children and have a very careful and strict decoration. An experience that will make us enjoy our holidays on a completely new level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <strong>hotel consultant</strong> is a <strong><a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/hotel-consulting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>professional</u></a> </strong>who is responsible for giving professional advice to investors or individuals who are interested in entering this business. They also provide support to hotels that are in operation.</p>
<p>Having a hotel consultant is actually very practical at all times: if the business is not going as well as expected, with their advice we can come out at the other side. However, even if it goes well, a hotel consultant may help us to prevent a crisis, as well as establish different strategies to consolidate and expand the brand on the market.</p>
<p>Even though they have been operating for some time, some hotels find it difficult knowing how to define their business model and the goals they want to accomplish. Different opportunities will arise, but they won&#8217;t know how to achieve them or what to do if they manage to obtain them. With a hotel consultant, they can identify the strong points of the hotel whilst connecting with any opportunities that arise or may arise.</p>
<p>We will now define the main duties of a <strong>hotel consultant</strong>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Main Duties Of A Hotel Consultant</h2>
<p>Prepare market studies.</p>
<p>Develop a project that adapts to the real needs of the market, as well as the location in which the hotel is placed.</p>
<p>Prepare feasibility studies for the project. This will determine whether the installation of a hotel is convenient, if it will be profitable, and other related matters.</p>
<p>They will also develop the Business Plan and Development Plan.</p>
<p>If the hotel is already in operation, the consultant may provide all the tools that allow it to organise processes, adapting to the customer&#8217;s demands at all times. To do this, they will use specialised programs in marketing and sales, operational hotel management, they will establish promotion strategies, as well as training and practice plans.</p>
<p>A <strong>hotel consultant</strong> will provide the hotel with a new look towards the market, helping the business to organise all its priorities and make all the relevant changes that will help it to become established as one of the best in the competitive market where it is situated.</p>
<p>With all of this we reiterate what we have already said: a hotel consultant is required one way or another, both if it is running well or if it is going through a bad time.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>If our hotel is not profitable, the time will have come to stop thinking about what we are doing wrong and try to find the error that is stopping us from moving forward.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Without further ado, we are going to analyse <strong>8 reasons</strong> that can help you to identify <strong>why your hotel is not profitable</strong> and resolve it immediately.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Why your hotel is not profitable?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Errors in choosing staff: </strong>If you do not choose your staff correctly, the hotel may not run as you would expect. The staff searching methods or those related to a choice of profile may be incorrect. Before making a decision regarding the new person we are going to hire, we must think twice.</li>
<li><strong>Not taking into account customer needs: </strong>The customer is everything, so we must always analyse their needs and determine how we are going to satisfy them. If the customer feels abandoned, it is likely that they will not hesitate in choosing a hotel chain that is competition to us.</li>
<li><strong>Not monitoring online reviews regarding our hotel: </strong>Almost 9 out of every 10 people read online reviews about a hotel before deciding to stay there. If we do not monitor these, trying to learn from the negative reviews, we will soon be left without customers and not even know the reason for it.</li>
<li><strong>Not knowing how to &#8220;sell&#8221; the hotel: </strong>The owner must know how to manage the hotel&#8217;s different sales channels, thoroughly analysing the potential of each channel, how to find the audience that best suits the business, how to segment this audience, monitor the competition, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Dedicating too much time to administrative bureaucracy: </strong>Whilst it is true that a hotel&#8217;s <em>paperwork</em>takes too much time, it can never take up the time required by other processes (such as customer service). If this does take up too much time, we should hire someone to take care of it.</li>
<li><strong>Not having the ability to solve problems: </strong>Running a hotel involves constantly identifying and solving problems. The manager must find a way of dealing with all of these problems before they get bigger.</li>
<li><strong>Bad organisation in the command post: </strong>In each link of the employee chain, there must be people prepared with the right skills. If this is not the case, the entire chain will break.</li>
<li><strong>Not hiring a hotel consultant: </strong>A <strong><u>hotel consultant</u></strong>will help you to consult the <em>health</em> of your business, establishing a strategy to resolve any problem that arises and the best ways to implement them. They have experience, a great work methodology, they adapt to new technologies and will give the hotel the attention it deserves. We must never see it as an expense, but rather an investment that will ensure us that everything will run as expected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid these errors and your hotel will run on the right track. If you need more information, please <a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>contact us</strong></a>.</p>
