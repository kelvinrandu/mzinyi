										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MAKING TOURISM A SUSTAINABLE OPTION IS THE GREAT CHALLENGE THAT THE DIFFERENT HOTEL CHAINS HAVE TO FACE IF THEY WANT TO FIND THEIR PLACE IN THE NEW ORDER OF THE SECTOR. THUS, THE INTEGRATION OF HOTEL SUSTAINABILITY MUST BE A PRIORITY TO GUARANTEE THE GROWTH OF THE TOURISM INDUSTRY, ENSURING THE PRESERVATION [&#8230;]</p>
<p>Making tourism a sustainable option is the great challenge that different hotel chains must face if they want to find their place in the new order of the sector. Thus, <b>the integration of hotel sustainability</b> must be a priority to guarantee the growth of the tourism industry, ensuring the preservation of the environment.</p>
<p>WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO ACT URGENTLY?</p>
<p>As the <b>World Tourism Organization (OMT)</b> points out<b>, &#8220;the principles of sustainability refer to the environmental, economic and socio-cultural aspects of tourism development</b> and they also state that an appropriate balance must be established between these three dimensions to guarantee its long-term sustainability&#8221;.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span></p>
<p><i>All this is based on a common objective: the reduction of the carbon footprint and greenhouse gases.  </i></p>
<p>So, <a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.cooleffect.org/why-carbon">what are greenhouse gases</a> in terms of tourism? The data from the most recent studies indicate that tourism produces 5% of the total greenhouse effect emissions worldwide. As explained by<b> the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership</b>, it is expected to increase by 130% by 2035, so the implementation of sustainability measures in hotels is crucial.</p>
<p>SOCIAL COMMITMENT TO PROMOTE HOTEL SUSTAINABILITY</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>Society is more committed than ever to preserving the environment, which is why they are more willing to invest in sustainable tourism. A <b>survey conducted by the TUI group</b>, which showed that young people are the sector that most wants to bet on a sustainable hotel for holidays.</p>
<p><i>Shifting hotel investment towards more environmentally friendly forms is presented as a long-term future commitment.</i></p>
<p>OMT GENERAL LINES FOR HOTEL SUSTAINABILITY</p>
<p>Following the OMT guidelines, a series of questions are established that must be fulfilled when making changes in hotel management whenever it concerns sustainability. The first one refers to the <b>optimization of environmental resources</b> for day-to-day work in the tourism industry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p>Second, <b>&#8220;the socio-cultural authenticity of the communities where tourism is framed must be respected.&#8221;</b> Regarding this aspect, it is important to highlight the importance of not breaking with the aesthetics of a territory by the inclusion of innovative elements. A balance must be found.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p>Finally, the OMT points out that economic activities derived from hotel sustainability <b>must provide employment opportunities for the inhabitants of the corresponding locality</b>, as well as income.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>MEASURES TO ACHIEVE FULL HOTEL SUSTAINABILITY</p>
<p>With the basis of the roadmap to be followed to implement sustainable measures, in the <b>Hotel Yearbook 2020</b>, Dr. Legrand, a sustainability expert, presents some ideas that are easily applicable that are becoming a trend.</p>
<p>DO NOT WASTE FOOD</p>
<p>Food production entails an environmental impact, which is why it is intended to establish <b>repurposing food menus</b> in the different hotel kitchens. Another option is to create your own organic gardens or buy in local markets to reduce your carbon footprint.</p>
<p>MINIMIZE THE CONSUMPTION OF WATER AND ELECTRICITY</p>
<p>By installing <b>water filter circuits </b>in showers, the consumption of this good can be substantially reduced. <b>The implementation of lighting sensors</b> also offers guarantees of electronic efficiency. Hotel Sustainability is a set of all these measures.</p>
<p>REJECT THE PLASTIC</p>
<p>An easy step in investing in hotel sustainability is to <b>substitute all single-use plastic products for reusable materials</b>, such as bamboo or glass. It is a measure that can be applied in water bottles, supplies of shampoo and gel, straws, utensils &#8230;</p>
<p>SUSTAINABLE technology</p>
<p>More and more hotels are investing in electronic devices to reduce paper consumption<b>. The centralization of documents in computerized databases</b> facilitates the reduction of consumption of this material.</p>
<p>CHOOSE ZERO KILOMETER PRODUCTS AND MATERIALS</p>
<p>Following the measure of promoting the development of the locality where the hotel is placed, the best option is zero kilometers. This section covers the <b>use of locally produced products and materials </b>so that not only profits are concentrated in the vicinity, but also pollution from transfers from more distant locations is reduced.</p>
