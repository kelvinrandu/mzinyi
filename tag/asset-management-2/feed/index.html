					<description><![CDATA[<p>Asset management is a concept that is quite in vogue within the hotel industry, but what does it really mean? It is considered to be the management of quick assets, which in turn is complimented by a good valuation analysis that allows you to define the most appropriate and profitable investment plan. </p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>These days, <strong>the investment market is bullish</strong>. There are many hotel owners, developers, and private investors who hold assets, but do not have the experience to find buyers; there are also new investors who are considering developing new hotel projects or simply potential investors who have trouble taking control of internal hotel management. This is where <strong>Asset Management comes in</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>In order to make a project a reality or improve one that is already up and running, you need investors</strong>. And to invest, you need professionals capable of gathering the right information and analyzing it so that you can make the right decisions. This is crucial to setting the project on a path to success. Internal hotel operations and their marketing and sales policies are tasks that must be carried out by professionals, in addition to ensuring that the acquired hotel asset has the <strong>right price and will provide good returns</strong>.</p>
<p>Increasing the value of an asset is essential in asset management; in fact, it is important to find strategies that are practical when increasing the value of the interests and ensuring that the hotel asset is sold in the best way possible. <strong><a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/hotel-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IHCS</a> has a global reach, managing assets in Spain and other areas in Europe, Latin America, Africa, and Asia.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Our team has experience operating and managing different kinds of assets</strong>. One of its most important objectives is to <strong>maximize the value and potential of all of these assets</strong> by recommending and implementing the necessary changes. Changes to hotel asset management have been marked; in recent years, the industry has changed its focus, seeking <strong>higher profit margins and streamlining Revenue Management.</strong></p>
<p>All Asset Management specialists manage <strong>general financial results from hotel assets, optimizing the return on their hospitality investment</strong>. A hotel may create an <strong>exceptional ROI</strong> by developing a unique product and creating an incredible experience for guests in order to reach the local market and <strong>make the asset the market leader</strong>. Nevertheless, doing a <strong>feasibility study is important in order to consider whether the hotel’s relationship to the market, location, costs, and financing are feasible.</strong></p>
<p>Keeping up-to-date with the <strong>latest investment and hotel distribution trends</strong> can be a real challenge, as they are constantly changing. Many hotels are set in the traditional ways of managing operations; that&#8217;s why it is important to take the hotel asset to the next level, thereby discovering its revenue potential. The hotel business is highly regulated and also liberalized, so, <strong>paying attention to the hotel business regulations set forth in each asset’s location is essential</strong>.</p>
<p>Accordingly, <strong>a key part of consulting is keeping track of the different licenses and permits associated with the hotel business,</strong> and understanding the conditions to maintain said licenses and permits in the event the hotel changes ownership is essential. Similarly, emphasizing the importance of reviewing urban planning matters that may negatively impact or even halt the future of the hotel&#8217;s business will require a detailed analysis providing sufficient guarantees for the buyer.</p>
<p><strong>All of this is part of a concept called “due diligence”.</strong> In purchase processes, carrying out several complex due diligence processes helps to prevent undesired surprises, considering the complexity of the hotel business and the myriad of permits, licenses, and details to be analyzed for everything to be in order.</p>
<p><strong>The increasing arrival of foreign investors</strong>, especially from the Asian market, interested in acquiring hotel assets <strong>makes having quality legal advice essential</strong>. These services aim to <strong>facilitate the transition and takeover of a new hotel for the hotel operator, minimizing issues and potentially unforeseen circumstances. </strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>The growth and expansion of the hotel industry has set the focus on internationalizing all business and tourism initiatives, developing different strategies, including divestment as a hotel growth model.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>First, you might be wondering “what is divestment?” Divestment is the reduction of a certain type of asset or the increase of a certain type of liability. In the case of hotels, this may be carried out for ethical or financial reasons, or due to the sale of an existing business. Reducing the total amount of ongoing hotel investments is also part of divesting.</p>
<p>In the last few months some of the largest international hotel chains in the world have been buying and selling hotels: NH, Intercontinental, Starwood, Hainan Airlines, Riu, and Best Western, among others. The divestment strategies of these and other hotel companies plus their expansion plans and therefore the construction of new properties are causing the economic flow to move at an unstoppable pace.</p>
<p>Today, the tourism industry is operating at full capacity, the real estate market is recovering, and <a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/es/blog/asset-management-en-la-industria-hotelera/">new investors</a> are showing their interest in different types of hotels. Divesting of less profitable assets is on the rise, as well as consulting on leases, rental, management, and franchising agreements for hotel projects. All of this is taking place in order to <strong>be able to free up capital and finance expansion into new international markets</strong>.</p>
<p>We are aware that the situation within the tourism and real estate industries is positive and that therefore divestment, changes to hotel management models, and corporate brand diversification are increasing proportionally, taking advantage of the closing of some hotel operations by international funds. This situation should help us when creating opportunities and allow us to get even more out of the asset portfolio while balancing it and creating value for future shareholders, profiting from the potential of the hotel portfolio held by the brand.</p>
<p>The challenge for most hotel entities is knowing how to take on asset acquisition processes reasonably, let the least interesting options go, and manage all of the profitable ones so that assets do not lose value over time while waiting for the best time to divest.</p>
<p>Divestment is synonymous with growth strategy: the moment when hotel managers put their asset portfolio on the table to assess the different options, and as a result, create a value line based on profitability, using the rotation of assets as a driver for growth both for large hotel brands and sub-brands, which will create more capital gains. Moreover, there are hotel managers who prefer renting, specifically fixed rents, as they grow on a greater scale compared to variable rents.</p>
<p>The trend of divestment within the business model to be carried out by hotel management groups continues to move toward models posing lower risk for operators. Within this context, the strong increase in franchising agreements in a market as fragmented as the hotel industry should be mentioned. This is a market in which independent owners are looking for management formulas parallel and complementary to their own, formulas that allow them to enter and position themselves in alternative markets.</p>
<p>The financial market crisis and the resulting credit restrictions directly affect the development of new projects and condition the expansion plans of hotel chains. <strong>At this point&#8230; How can a hotel consultancy firm like ours help?</strong> With our hotel Asset Management service; a consulting service for hotel asset owners aiming to reach their projected break-even points. With this service, we supervise and control the investment and <a href="https://www.hosteltur.com/192720_mercado-inversion-hotelera-acogera-nuevos-compradores-desinversiones.html">divestment</a> strategy, assessing the property in the right investment strategies, analyzing and evaluating the transaction market, selecting the right hotel operators, and administrating management contracts until the right time for divestment arrives.</p>
