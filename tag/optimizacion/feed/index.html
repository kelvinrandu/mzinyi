					<description><![CDATA[<p>In today’s competitive setting, hotels are becoming increasingly aware of the positive results obtained through the advice and contributions of consulting firms. Hotel owners and managers are asking themselves much more frequently whether they are making the most of future demand, their financial yield is appropriate or they are attracting the customers with the most potential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The services provided by consulting firms <strong>specifically target hotel owners and managers who at some point in their career feel the need to obtain assistance or advice in addressing an array of problems and implementing continuous improvement processes</strong>. Therefore, the fundamental goal is to recommend viable solutions and to implement appropriate measures aimed at increasing the hotel&#8217;s productivity and competitiveness.</p>
<p>Before making any decisions and taking action, a number of processes and objectives must first be considered. <strong>The consulting firm must identify the needs, the areas for improvement, the technological tools available, and how to move forward</strong>. As far as the financial aspects, hotel owners and managers have and will continue to have more freedom in deciding what to do with their inventory and prices. Of course, they can always receive financial advice from their financial advisors, who they may have sought out after attending their financial seminar (<a href="https://www.leadjig.com/financial-seminar-marketing/">check it out</a> here) to help them come to a conclusion about whether their financial strategy is working in their favour or not. The outcome could determine how successful your hotel will be in the long run. Most are focused on achieving the highest occupancy possible and would rather fill the hotel than sell their rooms at a slightly higher price.</p>
<p>We already know that<strong>  </strong><a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/blog/how-to-implement-a-proper-strategy-for-revenue-management-in-hotels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>revenue management</strong></a><strong>  strives to improve a hotel establishment&#8217;s current pricing strategy through the use of an automated system</strong>. This system has expanded significantly in recent years and its development has shown exponential growth, in line with technological advances. However, despite the number of years that revenue management has existed in the hotel industry, there continue to be a number of false myths or inaccurate ideas about it , so a strong knowledge base is essential.</p>
<p>The <strong>benefits of hiring a professional hotel consulting firm</strong> to  <strong>stimulate a hotel&#8217;s financial yield</strong> can be summarized as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using new financial measurement criteria and operational instruments.</li>
<li>Analyzing the standard team operations, philosophy and corporate mission to ensure they are aligned.</li>
<li>Applying strategies to boost revenue, yield management techniques and operating cost management.</li>
<li>Focusing on the details and identifying the fundamental keys in establishing the loyalty of potential customers.</li>
<li>Providing access (and adjusting) to new technologies, markets and challenges.</li>
<li>Lowering costs and increasing the return on investment.</li>
<li>Taking into consideration indicators such as RevPar (revenue per available room), one of the most important indicators for hotel owners and managers.</li>
<li>Defining the company&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses, its resistance to change, how it operates as a hotel system, and the criteria needed for its corporate and financial health.</li>
<li>Obtaining an impartial and innovative perspective for problem solving.</li>
<li>Establishing a program to implement continuous improvement processes and solutions, and putting into practice the suggested solutions.</li>
<li>Applying upselling and cross-selling techniques, along with a good online marketing and social media strategy. These items are extremely effective at increasing a hotel&#8217;s revenue as well as improving product quality and guest satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  <strong>opportunities of Big Data, improvements to technology, descriptive analysis methods and more extensive revenue management training</strong> have generated a great deal of interest in the industry towards this field.</p>
<p><strong>How does a hotel consulting firm help us obtain investors for new projects?</strong></p>
<p>When considering a new project, a consulting firm can help you create a solid business plan and then find the  <strong>investors</strong>  that are needed to  <strong>make a new project a reality or to improve an existing project.</strong></p>
<p>In summary, it is important to be surrounded by experienced professionals who help us collect the necessary information so it can then be analyzed properly. One of the aims of consulting firms is to  <strong>identify the most attractive hotel assets</strong>  along with those that best fit the type of investments we are making.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Do you have an idea but you don’t know how to execute on it? Do you want to invest in a project creating a hotel? Are you an independent hotel that needs to optimise your brand?</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you&#8217;re taking the first steps to set things in motion, we invite you to save on time, effort and money&#8230;<strong>at IHCS, we have the solution and our consulting firm can help you.</strong></p>
<p><span class="fontstyle2"><a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/blog/do-you-want-to-improve-your-results-ihcs-will-find-the-best-hotel-solution/">International Hotel Consulting Services</a> specialises in the development of hotel projects of all kinds, among other services it provides, and has invaluable <strong>international experience to advise and guide entrepreneurs from all over the world in getting their hotel projects off the ground.</strong> Hotels constantly innovate and there are increasingly more of them changing their value proposition to attract more customers, which is why the hotel industry has seen fit to reinvent itself, in order to provide guests with something that goes beyond just good accommodation.</p>
<p>There are many hotel chains that are revolutionising the customer experience by offering smart hotel rooms and creating new spaces that meet expectations in line with European trends; they are taking the hotel sector by storm. <strong>Popular thinking has evolved across the generations and creating memories is now considered to be preferable to owning material things, which is a great opportunity for hoteliers when building customer loyalty.</strong></p>
<p>Over the past few years, we have been undergoing a revolution of new ideas, particularly in the field of new technologies. We already know that customers are always on the lookout for new concepts and experiences, which is why opening doors to the future is key and should not be left by the wayside. <strong>IHCS brings differentiation and added value to your projects through a keen eye for detail, integrating tools, systems, management and marketing strategies that contribute to optimising the process.</strong></p>
<p>Many hotel projects launched have not been studied with due care, resulting in ventures that don&#8217;t do well, fail to turn a profit and require higher than expected investments. It is very likely that none of these project leaders utilized the idea of a <a href="https://www.prosymmetry.com/features/project-scheduling/">project scheduling software</a> to help keep on top of any tasks that needed to be completed, hence the downfall of their hotel plans. This is where our Project Development services come into play, as we know the market and we can adapt to any type of hotel.</p>
<h2>What can we help you with when creating the business plan for your hotel?</h2>
<h3>Definition Of Concept</h3>
<p>We will analyse your competitors, the trends and the market to help you define the type of hotel that will be the most profitable for you at present and in the future. Independent, family-friendly, adult-only, boutique hotels&#8230;we&#8217;ll help you decide which of these suits the project best according to the investment budget.</p>
<h3>Profitability Study</h3>
<p>Bringing an idea to life involves doing a feasibility study with regard to all aspects, particularly economic and technical aspects. Knowing the return on investment is also very important when drawing up a feasible plan for the future and assuring ourselves that the idea is profitable.</p>
<h3>Feasibility Analysis</h3>
<p>Defining the hotel category, room prices, occupancy, etc. is a crucial step when starting a business. The same goes for analysing profitability by type of customer, thus building loyalty among the customers that will be the most profitable for us. Through segmentation, we evaluate customers, thus contributing positively to the project.</p>
<h3>Business Strategy Planning</h3>
<p>Promotional and sales strategies are factors for success in any hotel project, which is why we cannot neglect to implement them. The most important aspects are sales management and promotion, together with negotiation techniques. Strategic business planning serves as a roadmap-a clearly defined path to help the organisation figure out how to get where it needs to go. Not to mention looking into investment methods such as dividends and learning things like <a href="https://kailashconcepts.com/research/">Exploiting Misvaluation </a>, which are all qualities that can make a business successful. </p>
<h3>Project Implementation</h3>
<p>This is the final stage of the process, as part of the action plan. We at IHCS will act as intermediaries and representatives when dealing with third parties to help you get the best results. Once this phase has been completed, your hotel will have become the hotel you&#8217;ve always dreamed of. In-depth knowledge of the sector and years of international experience drive us to only one direction, making the best decisions to achieve the ultimate goal: turning your hotel into reality.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>&#8220;Long-range planning does not deal with future decisions, but with the future of present decisions.&#8221;</strong></p>
