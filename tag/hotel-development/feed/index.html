										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hotel Management Company is a firm that is determined to manage all of the daily tasks of a hotel. From making sure that the guest rooms look right to keep an eye on the daily profits, a hotel management company makes sure that everything is running smoothly.</p>
<p>Most of the people around us are unaware of the fact that the well-known hotels around the globe hire professional hotel management companies to run their business. However, the question arises, how can one believe in a particular hotel management company? For this purpose, the IHCS hotel consulting company is always ready to help independent hotel owners or investors. IHCS is the solution to all of your worries and is always available to provide you the best solutions for selecting your dream hotel management company. We have staff with years of practical experience to provide the best to our customers.</p>
<p>The importance of having the right hotel management company can never be denied, and while thinking about the best, no one can deny the name of IHCS. Let us see in detail that what are the criteria and benefits one can get by the search and selection for the right hotel management company.</p>
<p><b>IHCS guide on selecting the right hotel management company</b></p>
<p>According to our experts, the following are the guidelines that one must focus on selecting the right hotel management company:</p>
<p><b>Maintain a competitive environment</b></p>
<p>Proprietors frequently fall for the principal management company they meet. They get welcome to visit the company&#8217;s most pleasant property, remain in a beautiful suite, appreciate a decent supper with the chiefs of the company, and, then before they know it, they feel submitted. Shockingly, management organizations are not equivalent, and management contract terms can change drastically. Establishing a serious climate from the beginning will compel the director to arrange an ideal arrangement and result in a more positive result for the proprietor. The most widely recognized technique to establish a competition is through the proposal process.</p>
<p><b>Get help from the right advisor</b></p>
<p>Hotels are working organizations, and the connection between proprietor and administrator is not a simple subject to handle. Most management organizations have broad experience in management arrangements and use both in-house and outside direction. Proprietorship ought to be correspondingly spoken to by specialists. All proprietors ought to be spoken to by specialists that have practical experience in hotel management arrangements.</p>
<p>Proprietors or owners with restricted involvement with hotel management choice additionally should enlist an accomplished hotel resource director to help them through the cycle and to work with management on a continuous premise to boost the estimation of the hotel. In the selection process of management, the advisor will assist the owners with clarifying objectives and, subsequently, give suggestions with respect to the best management company for the hotel.</p>
<p><b>Explain your objectives</b></p>
<p>Maximizing the estimation is ordinarily the owner&#8217;s essential objective and is the reason for most choices. However, boosting isn&#8217;t as basic as it appears. An engineer constructing a full-administration hotel in a high boundary to-section metropolitan market may be best served by keeping the hotel autonomous. However, additionally, it could be a genuinely dangerous technique. Different hotel owners are not propelled by the productivity of their hotels yet are more worried about the effect of the hotel on other factors. For instance, schools and colleges regularly are more worried about securing their relationship with the network and their image picture than with the main concern benefit. Whatever the objective, understanding the objectives is a significant factor to consider while choosing a management company.</p>
<p><b>Understand your hotel</b></p>
<p>Each hotel is special. Many offer similar features, yet none are equivalent. Hotels are not just a component of their room check and actual item; they likewise are characterized by their area, the interest on the lookout, and their opposition. Sharp owners will have a careful comprehension of their hotel whether or not it&#8217;s a current property or new development. Moreover, ownership ought to have a decent comprehension of the hotel&#8217;s capital requirements and extended money related execution. In conclusion, understanding the hotel&#8217;s attractive quality to administrators is necessary.</p>
<p>After the hotel owners have focused on all of the four above-mentioned factors, the next step is to hire a company that seems suitable for their business based on the results of these factors prescribed by IHCS.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WEIGHING AND ANALYZING THE VIABILITY OF A HOTEL ESTABLISHMENT ARE TWO OF THE KEYS TO DETERMINE THE SUCCESS OF SUCH INVESTMENT. THAT IS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO MAKE A CORRECT JUSTIFICATION OF A HOTEL PROJECT IF YOU WANT TO FIND QUALITY INVESTORS TO MAKE YOUR IDEA A REALITY.</p>
<p>Weighing and analyzing the viability of a hotel establishment are two of the keys to determining this investment&#8217;s success. That is why it is essential to correctly justify a hotel project if you want to find quality investors to make your idea come true.</p>
<p><b>STEPS FOR THE JUSTIFICATION OF A HOTEL PROJECT</b></p>
<p>To develop a hotel project, it is essential to previously prepare a report capable of justifying its creation and future viability. At IHCS, we have extensive experience advising and guiding entrepreneurs worldwide when starting their hotel projects.</p>
<p><b>INITIAL MARKET ANALYSIS</b></p>
<p>Betting on the development of a hotel establishment in Spain is always a long-term investment with ample success guarantees. All this is because it is a country where tourism constitutes an integral part of its GDP. According to data from the latest analysis of the Statista portal, in 2019, hotel investment exceeded 2,500 million euros.</p>
<p>In this way, we found that when it comes to justifying a hotel project, choosing Spain as the establishment&#8217;s location is a plus.</p>
<p><b>INTERNATIONAL TOURISM CHOOSES HOTEL ESTABLISHMENTS</b></p>
<p>Is it viable to bet on a hotel project in Spain? The numbers speak for themselves. In 2019, a year marked by the emergence and growth of tourist housing &#8211; the main competitor of hotel establishments &#8211; hotel occupancy exceeded 70% in all hotels throughout the country.</p>
<p><b>HOTEL PROFILE AS A PROJECT</b></p>
<p>It is also important to decide what type of hotel establishment you want to develop. The needs of a five-star resort will not be the same as that of a rural hotel. At IHCS, we are always committed to carrying out a detailed analysis of the profile sought with its defining characteristics.</p>
<p>According to statistical studies, foreign tourists tend to opt for four-star hotels, where the average number of overnight stays is 3.2 days. Considering the place where the hotel project will be established, it will be essential to determine what type of tourists are expected to adapt the facilities to a more splendid reception.</p>
<p><b>DEFINITION OF THE PRODUCT AND ITS SERVICES</b></p>
<p>After making the hotel profile that you want to develop, the next step will be to define it completely. Size, number of rooms, facilities, terrain, the architectural and decorative style would be framed at this point &#8230;</p>
<p>But it will also be necessary to make a list where the services you want to offer in the said establishment are reflected. Differentiating from the hotel offers can be an advantage for specific audiences. For example, offering pet-friendly services may come across as a convenience for some families. Also, determine if it will be an exclusive access hotel for families without children can attract a specific public. Each project will have to bet on a particular strength.</p>
<p>Finally, the rates will also be an important determining factor for guests. Carrying out a market study will be easy to see which margins are best suited to the project according to its benefits.</p>
<p>Investors will want to find in the justification of a hotel project absolutely everything that will define the establishment.</p>
<p><b>COMMERCIAL AND MARKETING STRATEGY</b></p>
<p>Today a project is nothing without a good plan of action to facilitate its commercialization. In this section, communication and marketing come into play, disciplines capable of marking a before and after in your project&#8217;s success. Thus, in the justification of a hotel project, it is recommended to include an action plan detailing the strategies to follow to achieve different objectives, mostly financial.</p>
