										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HOTEL REVPAR IS CONSIDERED THE MOST IMPORTANT METRIC IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY. tHE REVENUE PER AVAILABLE ROOM IS ESTABLISHED AS THE INDEX THAT VALUES THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF A CHAIN ​​OR ESTABLISHMENT.</p>
<p>This indicator measures the profitability generated by the rooms, in other words, it shows us the number of rooms that were occupied and how much was received by each of them. Below we will look at the appropriate strategies to increase our hotel&#8217;s RevPAR and, consequently, increase our profits.</p>
<p>As a professional performance indicator, RevPAR is critical in the hospitality industry. This ratio allows us to know with precision the financial reality of the establishment we manage.</p>
<p>RevPAR can be used by hotel owners to adjust hotel rates in order to maximize revenue or even as a tourism promotion formula.</p>
<p>It is essential to know what is the minimum RevPAR that must be achieved to obtain benefits in your accommodation in order to establish a <b>revenue management</b> <b>strategy</b> suited to your needs according to the characteristics of the establishment.</p>
<p><b>WHAT IS REVPAR HOTELS AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN?</b></p>
<p>As with other hotel occupancy metrics parameters that we have had the opportunity to discuss in previous articles on hotel management, RevPAR may not even sound familiar to you if you are not closely related to the accommodation industry.</p>
<p>In terms of <b>hotel accounting</b>, this index is calculated taking into account the number of rooms and will evaluate the financial performance of a hotel, calibrating the benefits obtained per room and always referring to a certain period of time, such as a week, a month or per year.</p>
<p><b>The RevPAR calculation</b> is simple: RevPAR, or revenue per available room, is a performance metric in the hotel industry that is calculated by dividing a hotel&#8217;s total guest-room revenue by the room count and the number of days in the period being measured.</p>
<p>How to determine if this result is correct? There are mechanisms to improve it and you can certainly do that.</p>
<p>But the interpretation of these indexes is not always straightforward. In an environment of such complexity as the hotelier, owners and managers perceive the need for an advisory service to solve several problems that affect the results of hotel management. At IHCS we have the necessary tools to identify the needs, the technological mechanisms we have and the right strategies within the scope of the concept of hotel revenue management to obtain the best accounting results.</p>
<p><b>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO KNOW MY HOTEL&#8217;S REVPAR?</b></p>
<p>Some of the fundamental axes are:</p>
<p>• <b>Control of results</b> in our hotel management. Thanks to this metric we can determine if the commercial strategy used for a season is giving the desired results or if changes are necessary.</p>
<p><b>• Revenue indicator</b>. RevPAR gives the team responsible for managing the tourism company&#8217;s finances an estimate of the income that the establishment will have in the coming months.</p>
<p>• Thanks to RevPAR, it is possible to know how far or near a hotel is reaching the ideal conditions of profitability.</p>
<p><b>HOW CAN WE IMPROVE REVPAR HOTELS?</b></p>
<p>The RevPAR Hotels index is part of the Revenue Management strategies, which aim to optimize the revenue of our hotel and obtain the highest possible profitability. Well, to improve the results we must consider two fundamental keys, such as the combination of our human resources and the exhaustive knowledge and satisfaction of our target client.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see in detail.</p>
<p>•<b> Knowledge of the client&#8217;s profile: </b>in order to implement Revenue Management market strategies, it is necessary to have knowledge of your client. You can use tools like Google Analytics and other Big Data tools to discover everything about your potential customers and act accordingly.</p>
<p><b>• Loyalty program</b>. A satisfied customer will always be the best ambassador for your accommodation. He himself will attract others, and so on; increasing revenue and, consequently, profits.</p>
<p>• <b>Customer experience.</b> Customers&#8217; interests have changed and so have their preferences and habits. Customers don&#8217;t mind paying more if they know that they will receive good service in all aspects of their stay: from the staff&#8217;s attention to the state of the facilities. It is about valuing a global experience. The customer notices all the details such as bad Wi-Fi or air conditioning. In that case, he will negatively evaluate the room and his entire stay.</p>
<p>• The presence of trained professionals in all departments will be a guarantee for the client.</p>
<p>• <b>Technologic solutions.</b> Today there are all kinds of tools that can help you with hotel management. These strategies will serve not only to optimize rates, but also to improve the overall customer experience.</p>
<p>To implement all these improvement strategies, it is not always enough to raise prices. Before making decisions like this, carefully study what your guests are looking for. Get some advice for better results. At IHCS, as a hotel consultant, we provide you with the necessary mechanisms to optimize your results and obtain financial performance. You will get the results you desire.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <strong>hotel consultant</strong> is a professional that can provide a new approach to our hotel, helping us to enhance certain aspects related to the team or to certain aspects of the organisation as a whole.</p>
<p>We will analyse this issue in depth so that you can learn about their duties in detail.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">What can the presence of a hotel consultant bring to us?</h2>
<p><strong>Capturing customers: </strong>They will be in charge of implementing different strategies that will help us to capture customers, as well as retain them. They will also segment the market in order to be able to identify the most predisposed profile to visit our complex.</p>
<p><strong>Increased profitability: </strong>They will also study any type of aspect that is related to the hotel&#8217;s viability; including the management of payments, prices of services, appropriate hiring of staff, payment of taxes&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Positioning the brand on the Internet: </strong>The Internet is an important resource that will help the world to learn more about our hotel. For example, should we have a hotel in Lanzarote, we can position our page with the appropriate terms so that, when a customer wants to stay in that place, we will appear in the first positions. Given the importance of this aspect, the <strong>hotel consultant</strong> will have the appropriate knowledge needed to extend the brand throughout the network.</p>
<h3>What does a hotel consultant bring to a hotel?</h3>
<p>In addition to all the aspects we have mentioned in the previous section, we will now see more specifically how having a hotel consultant can benefit us.</p>
<h4>Identifies the technology that most suits the business</h4>
<p>Computerisation is key in hotels; a suitable software must be used to manage employee payrolls, customer details, payments, supplier agreements, as well as any other related aspect.</p>
<p>As there is a high quantity of hotel software existing on the market, choosing the most suitable one for us is not an easy task; a <strong>hotel consultant</strong> will have the appropriate knowledge, based on the type of hotel and its needs, to choose the most suitable technology.</p>
<h4>Adaptation to the market</h4>
<p>The truth is that the hotel sector is evolving at a very progressive rate, and it is very possible that your competition has overtaken you. Knowing how to go one step ahead will help us attract customers and strengthen the business.</p>
<p>A hotel consultant will be in tune with the latest changes; in this way, you can adapt to the market to achieve the best results.</p>
<h4>Better time management</h4>
<p>The vast majority of hotels waste time doing some manual tasks that could be automated. A <strong>hotel consultant</strong> will have the right tools to automate different processes; this will not only save time, it will also save money.</p>
<p>For all of these reasons, hiring a hotel consultant may be the best decision of your life, something that really will keep the business afloat or simply improve profits.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Productivity is a factor that must be controlled in any business at all times and is that if a business ceases to be productive or we do something to turn the situation around, it will not fail to fail.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hotel sector is working with increasingly tighter margins, and more aggressive competition is trying to get the better of us. That&#8217;s why it is important to squeeze the most out of resources and try to make more from less.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Can we improve the productivity of our team?</h2>
<p><strong>Before we look to staff to improve hotel productivity, we need to ask ourselves the following questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have we defined what tasks each employee should complete on their shift? What tasks does each department have? Have we measured how long these tasks take and how much they cost?</li>
<li>Do we have the advanced management tools we need to control our business&#8217; activity?</li>
<li>Do we know what the business&#8217; &#8216;fat&#8217; is?</li>
</ul>
<p>By &#8216;fat&#8217; we mean the activities or behaviours that could slow staff down when completing their tasks, generating idle periods of time, bottlenecks, and repetitive tasks. In other words, it is the time that an employee does not have a specific task to do and spends it doing unproductive activities.</p>
<h3>Improving the hotel productivity by better managing shifts and flexibility</h3>
<p>Answering these questions is the first step you need to take before assessing if your planning is stable or if you should modify anything.</p>
<p>You need to determine <strong>the number of bookings you have</strong> and get an idea of the influx; these figures will indicate how many staff members you need on the team, and whether to include more or fewer shifts.</p>
<p>When we talk about flexibility, we&#8217;re referring to the dynamism related to assigning shifts and working hours to hotel employees, in accordance with the tasks foreseen.</p>
<p>The hotel does not have the solvency needed to always bear the same costs when it comes to paying staff wages. At times when there is more work, the costs associated with keeping staff are incredibly high.</p>
<p>To avoid this, <strong>flexi-time</strong> can be employed, where a given number of work hours are placed in a &#8216;bank&#8217; for busier periods, and employees are not required to work during quieter times. This &#8216;<strong>bank</strong>&#8216; helps keep a control, trying to ensure that the employee is productive during the period of time that they are contracted, paying them extra hours where necessary.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important that the hotel works with advanced management tools to control everything mentioned above and assign tasks to employees, manage incidents and special working hours, etc.</p>
<p>With these key factors, our <strong>hotel productivity</strong> is improved thanks <a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/blog/staff-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>to good staff management</strong></a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Hotel communication: tips for improving it</h2>
<h3>Make your vision known</h3>
<p>In order to avoid confusion among the different employees, it will be crucial for each member of staff to know the mission and vision of the company. They must know both the short and long-term goals.</p>
<p>This will help them to be motivated, so they will feel more involved with the hotel.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>It is worth remembering that communication is a type of skill that must be learned. If you realise that there are significant problems with communication at your hotel, you should start thinking of offering training courses to the staff, so that they can overcome these barriers that could end with the business going bankrupt.</p>
<h3>Launch strategies that encourage teamwork</h3>
<p>Experts say that a good way of breaking the communication barriers is to launch initiatives to encourage our employees to work as a team. For example, we can create certain out-of-office events to improve trust among the employees and allow them to form close relationships.</p>
<h3>Constantly organise meetings</h3>
<p>In order to achieve an effective communication system at the company, this must be maintained regularly. This is why you should organise at least one meeting per week. The idea is for both yourself and your employees to get up-to-date with what is happening at the hotel.</p>
<p>We must take advantage of this moment to listen to any complaints and suggestions that they wish to convey to us.</p>
<h3>Reaction</h3>
<p>All companies have communication problems at any given time; either due to the inefficiency of management, incompetent employees or for any other reason. The biggest companies have learned to act on any abnormal sign, preventing it from going any further.</p>
<p>If you are prepared for what may happen and take the appropriate measures before everything gets worse, you will save the situation.</p>
<p>These strategies are key for improving communication at a hotel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Adult only</em></strong> hotels have become a global trend. They emerged in Spain at the end of the last decade, with the feature of being designed so that we can enjoy time with our partner, to find tranquillity, luxury and pure relaxation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Adult only hotels: the key feature</h3>
<p>According to statistics, the number of bookings at this type of accommodation have multiplied 3 times in recent years; therefore, we are talking about a tourism that interests people. This explains why the number of hotels dedicated to this sector have increased in such a way.</p>
<p>These hotels began to establish themselves on the market throughout the 70s, a time when &#8220;honeymoon&#8221; holidays reached their highest point.</p>
<p>For example, in the Caribbean there are some hotels with areas specially designed for adults, or those that only allow adults to stay. In Europe we can find these in countries such as Spain and Croatia; and in Asia, in Bali. Other hotel chains also offer the possibility to improve this adult only service by offering butlers, swimming pools and private beaches, double jacuzzis in the bedrooms, as well as exclusive access to VIP areas.</p>
<h3>All inclusive luxury: an option to make customers feel at home</h3>
<p>This option has been designed so that the customer has everything they are looking for with no restrictions; to feel as comfortable as they are at home, but with the same benefits offered to them by the resort.</p>
<p>The people who book these hotels are aged between 30 and 50 years; moreover, their family income is calculated to be approximately above €60,000.</p>
<p>Thus, unlike what is achieved at other hotels, the goal is not only to provide stays to the user, but also a customised experience. The customer who hires this service wants to customise it as they please; in doing so, the likelihood that they return will be much higher.</p>
<p>It is calculated that, to date, there are more than 140 hotels with an <strong><em>Adults Only</em></strong><em> </em>option throughout the market; of these, 74 are located in the Balearic Islands, another 30 in the Canary Islands and 20 in Mainland Spain. It is estimated that there will be a total of more than 600 establishments across the world. The vast majority of them are rather small, with facilities that do not suit children and have a very careful and strict decoration. An experience that will make us enjoy our holidays on a completely new level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <strong>hotel consultant</strong> is a <strong><a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/hotel-consulting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>professional</u></a> </strong>who is responsible for giving professional advice to investors or individuals who are interested in entering this business. They also provide support to hotels that are in operation.</p>
<p>Having a hotel consultant is actually very practical at all times: if the business is not going as well as expected, with their advice we can come out at the other side. However, even if it goes well, a hotel consultant may help us to prevent a crisis, as well as establish different strategies to consolidate and expand the brand on the market.</p>
<p>Even though they have been operating for some time, some hotels find it difficult knowing how to define their business model and the goals they want to accomplish. Different opportunities will arise, but they won&#8217;t know how to achieve them or what to do if they manage to obtain them. With a hotel consultant, they can identify the strong points of the hotel whilst connecting with any opportunities that arise or may arise.</p>
<p>We will now define the main duties of a <strong>hotel consultant</strong>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Main Duties Of A Hotel Consultant</h2>
<p>Prepare market studies.</p>
<p>Develop a project that adapts to the real needs of the market, as well as the location in which the hotel is placed.</p>
<p>Prepare feasibility studies for the project. This will determine whether the installation of a hotel is convenient, if it will be profitable, and other related matters.</p>
<p>They will also develop the Business Plan and Development Plan.</p>
<p>If the hotel is already in operation, the consultant may provide all the tools that allow it to organise processes, adapting to the customer&#8217;s demands at all times. To do this, they will use specialised programs in marketing and sales, operational hotel management, they will establish promotion strategies, as well as training and practice plans.</p>
<p>A <strong>hotel consultant</strong> will provide the hotel with a new look towards the market, helping the business to organise all its priorities and make all the relevant changes that will help it to become established as one of the best in the competitive market where it is situated.</p>
<p>With all of this we reiterate what we have already said: a hotel consultant is required one way or another, both if it is running well or if it is going through a bad time.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Without further ado, we are going to analyse <strong>8 reasons</strong> that can help you to identify <strong>why your hotel is not profitable</strong> and resolve it immediately.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Why your hotel is not profitable?</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Errors in choosing staff: </strong>If you do not choose your staff correctly, the hotel may not run as you would expect. The staff searching methods or those related to a choice of profile may be incorrect. Before making a decision regarding the new person we are going to hire, we must think twice.</li>
<li><strong>Not taking into account customer needs: </strong>The customer is everything, so we must always analyse their needs and determine how we are going to satisfy them. If the customer feels abandoned, it is likely that they will not hesitate in choosing a hotel chain that is competition to us.</li>
<li><strong>Not monitoring online reviews regarding our hotel: </strong>Almost 9 out of every 10 people read online reviews about a hotel before deciding to stay there. If we do not monitor these, trying to learn from the negative reviews, we will soon be left without customers and not even know the reason for it.</li>
<li><strong>Not knowing how to &#8220;sell&#8221; the hotel: </strong>The owner must know how to manage the hotel&#8217;s different sales channels, thoroughly analysing the potential of each channel, how to find the audience that best suits the business, how to segment this audience, monitor the competition, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Dedicating too much time to administrative bureaucracy: </strong>Whilst it is true that a hotel&#8217;s <em>paperwork</em>takes too much time, it can never take up the time required by other processes (such as customer service). If this does take up too much time, we should hire someone to take care of it.</li>
<li><strong>Not having the ability to solve problems: </strong>Running a hotel involves constantly identifying and solving problems. The manager must find a way of dealing with all of these problems before they get bigger.</li>
<li><strong>Bad organisation in the command post: </strong>In each link of the employee chain, there must be people prepared with the right skills. If this is not the case, the entire chain will break.</li>
<li><strong>Not hiring a hotel consultant: </strong>A <strong><u>hotel consultant</u></strong>will help you to consult the <em>health</em> of your business, establishing a strategy to resolve any problem that arises and the best ways to implement them. They have experience, a great work methodology, they adapt to new technologies and will give the hotel the attention it deserves. We must never see it as an expense, but rather an investment that will ensure us that everything will run as expected.</li>
</ul>
<p>Avoid these errors and your hotel will run on the right track. If you need more information, please <a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><strong>contact us</strong></a>.</p>

<p><strong>It seeks to improve efficiency and operational process performance</strong>, strategies are established so that a hotel can be differentiated from what its competitors offer, better ways are sought to improve user experience and customer satisfaction, etc. It also covers all aspects concerning workers (such as hiring, firing, paying salaries, performance improvement), as well as a whole succession of processes relating to operational cost savings.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Hotel Management Aims</h2>
<p>Quite a common mistake is to think that <strong>hotel management</strong> is a set of operational processes that are simply aimed at improving customer service. As we have already seen, it controls other things at the same time and although it is true that customers are the ones who in the end benefit from it all, they are not the only ones.</p>
<p>We attempt to satisfy the needs of tourists, which involves quite a challenge; since each user has individual expectations. But we can say that ultimately customer satisfaction is most important.</p>
<p>To facilitate the process, a detailed analysis is usually conducted to ascertain customer service demand, all available products are classified (these are referred to as inventories), supplier system functioning is analysed as well as transport and storage management.</p>
<p>To carry out all these processes, comprehensive global and individual strategic planning has to be undertaken. For example, demand analysis will be studied based on supply. The idea behind this analysis is to be able to offer customers the kind of product they need, thus avoiding stock shortages, but at the same time that stock may be spoilt because too large an order has been placed.</p>
<p>To achieve <strong>optimum hotel management</strong>, the maximum possible market information must be available, such as socio-economic status, food and drink preferences, collective level of satisfaction, the type of tourist the hotel is targeting, accommodation packages and seasonality of demand, etc.</p>
<p>The most common course of action is to hire a <a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/hotel-consulting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>hotel consultancy firm</strong></a> which undertakes to perform good  <strong>hotel management aims</strong>, controlling all the processes in detail. If this is not possible, you can always outsource the service, such that a specialist company, with a proven track record, can look after everything such as IHCS Hotel Consulting.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we have said on other occasions, the main task of a hotel consultancy consists of professionally advising investors or people interested in entering the hotel sector and in helping already-operating hotels or resorts, which are generally independent, to improve all their processes with the aim of earning greater profits.</p>
<p>At IHCS, we aim to offer hotel consultancy so that you can go further. We advise entrepreneurs, companies, business owners, and executives with the aim of helping them improve the management of their organisations and resources so that they are more profitable whilst expending less effort and optimising costs.</p>
<p>With IHCS hotel consultancy, advising can be periodic and consultative, through the commissioning of studies or projects, or can be medium- or long-term accompaniment that is integrated into the business.</p>
<p><strong>HOTEL CONSULTANCY FOR YOUR BUSINESS PLAN </strong></p>
<p>At IHCS, all of our consultants have solid experience both in operations and more business-focused areas. Therefore, we know perfectly well how to advise you so that you rapidly improve and optimise specific areas of the hotel that are currently making your business less profitable than you imagined.</p>
<p>If you identify with any of the following points, then it’s possible that you need our<strong> hotel consultancy</strong>:</p>
<ol>
<li>I don’t know what technology best suits my needs and I don’t have the time or the resources to figure it out</li>
<li>I use hotel software but I don’t get the data or reports that I would like</li>
<li>The hospitality sector is evolving very quickly and I have the feeling that my competition knows something that I don&#8217;t</li>
<li>I want to automate processes that used to be fine to do manually, but now I don’t have the time or the resources</li>
</ol>
<p>There are many more reasons, as we mentioned in <a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/blog/hotel-consulting-what-is-it-really-about/"><strong>a previous post</strong></a> on hotel consultancy. If you feel that in 2018, you need to make a change to your business plan or simply need help to start one, don&#8217;t hesitate to contact us so that we can better advise you on hotel consultancy.</p>
