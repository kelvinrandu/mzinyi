										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>MAKING TOURISM A SUSTAINABLE OPTION IS THE GREAT CHALLENGE THAT THE DIFFERENT HOTEL CHAINS HAVE TO FACE IF THEY WANT TO FIND THEIR PLACE IN THE NEW ORDER OF THE SECTOR. THUS, THE INTEGRATION OF HOTEL SUSTAINABILITY MUST BE A PRIORITY TO GUARANTEE THE GROWTH OF THE TOURISM INDUSTRY, ENSURING THE PRESERVATION [&#8230;]</p>
<p>Making tourism a sustainable option is the great challenge that different hotel chains must face if they want to find their place in the new order of the sector. Thus, <b>the integration of hotel sustainability</b> must be a priority to guarantee the growth of the tourism industry, ensuring the preservation of the environment.</p>
<p>WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO ACT URGENTLY?</p>
<p>As the <b>World Tourism Organization (OMT)</b> points out<b>, &#8220;the principles of sustainability refer to the environmental, economic and socio-cultural aspects of tourism development</b> and they also state that an appropriate balance must be established between these three dimensions to guarantee its long-term sustainability&#8221;.</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span></p>
<p><i>All this is based on a common objective: the reduction of the carbon footprint and greenhouse gases.  </i></p>
<p>So, <a style="color: blue;" href="https://www.cooleffect.org/why-carbon">what are greenhouse gases</a> in terms of tourism? The data from the most recent studies indicate that tourism produces 5% of the total greenhouse effect emissions worldwide. As explained by<b> the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership</b>, it is expected to increase by 130% by 2035, so the implementation of sustainability measures in hotels is crucial.</p>
<p>SOCIAL COMMITMENT TO PROMOTE HOTEL SUSTAINABILITY</p>
<p><span class="Apple-converted-space">   </span>Society is more committed than ever to preserving the environment, which is why they are more willing to invest in sustainable tourism. A <b>survey conducted by the TUI group</b>, which showed that young people are the sector that most wants to bet on a sustainable hotel for holidays.</p>
<p><i>Shifting hotel investment towards more environmentally friendly forms is presented as a long-term future commitment.</i></p>
<p>OMT GENERAL LINES FOR HOTEL SUSTAINABILITY</p>
<p>Following the OMT guidelines, a series of questions are established that must be fulfilled when making changes in hotel management whenever it concerns sustainability. The first one refers to the <b>optimization of environmental resources</b> for day-to-day work in the tourism industry.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p>Second, <b>&#8220;the socio-cultural authenticity of the communities where tourism is framed must be respected.&#8221;</b> Regarding this aspect, it is important to highlight the importance of not breaking with the aesthetics of a territory by the inclusion of innovative elements. A balance must be found.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span></p>
<p>Finally, the OMT points out that economic activities derived from hotel sustainability <b>must provide employment opportunities for the inhabitants of the corresponding locality</b>, as well as income.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>MEASURES TO ACHIEVE FULL HOTEL SUSTAINABILITY</p>
<p>With the basis of the roadmap to be followed to implement sustainable measures, in the <b>Hotel Yearbook 2020</b>, Dr. Legrand, a sustainability expert, presents some ideas that are easily applicable that are becoming a trend.</p>
<p>DO NOT WASTE FOOD</p>
<p>Food production entails an environmental impact, which is why it is intended to establish <b>repurposing food menus</b> in the different hotel kitchens. Another option is to create your own organic gardens or buy in local markets to reduce your carbon footprint.</p>
<p>MINIMIZE THE CONSUMPTION OF WATER AND ELECTRICITY</p>
<p>By installing <b>water filter circuits </b>in showers, the consumption of this good can be substantially reduced. <b>The implementation of lighting sensors</b> also offers guarantees of electronic efficiency. Hotel Sustainability is a set of all these measures.</p>
<p>REJECT THE PLASTIC</p>
<p>An easy step in investing in hotel sustainability is to <b>substitute all single-use plastic products for reusable materials</b>, such as bamboo or glass. It is a measure that can be applied in water bottles, supplies of shampoo and gel, straws, utensils &#8230;</p>
<p>SUSTAINABLE technology</p>
<p>More and more hotels are investing in electronic devices to reduce paper consumption<b>. The centralization of documents in computerized databases</b> facilitates the reduction of consumption of this material.</p>
<p>CHOOSE ZERO KILOMETER PRODUCTS AND MATERIALS</p>
<p>Following the measure of promoting the development of the locality where the hotel is placed, the best option is zero kilometers. This section covers the <b>use of locally produced products and materials </b>so that not only profits are concentrated in the vicinity, but also pollution from transfers from more distant locations is reduced.</p>
<p>COMMITMENT TO HOTEL SUSTAINABILITY</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ADAPTATION TO THE DIVERSITY OF PAYMENT MEANS HAS BECOME A SUBJECT OF HUGE IMPORTANCE IN HOTEL MANAGEMENT. THE EVOLUTION OF THE SECTOR CALLS FOR THE PROGRESSIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE START-UP AND OPTIMISATION OF CASHLESS PAYMENT, OR CASHLESS PAYMENT, AS THE MOST INNOVATIVE, QUICK AND ACCORDING TO NEW CUSTOMER DEMANDS.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS CASHLESS? DEFINITION</strong></p>
<p>The cashless system, currently widespread in major events (concerts, fairs, amusement parks, festivals, etc.) consists of a cashless payment system with a virtual mode (mobile phone, digital watch, rechargeable wristbands) its virtual currency and through the so-called NFC technology.</p>
<p>This NFC (Near Field Communication) platform is a wireless communication system designed to communicate two technological devices at a short distance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This platform, which does not necessarily have to be connected to the internet, allows the collection and exchange of data and making payments through our mobile phone and, consequently, the reduction of cash.</p>
<p>In a changing society, the accommodation industry should integrate these new forms of economic transactions in hotel companies: New customers, new payment systems, which provide a series of advantages that we can see below.</p>
<p><strong>THE CASHLESS SYSTEM: ADVANTAGES FOR THE HOTEL</strong></p>
<p>The implementation of the cashless system in the hotel sector seems unstoppable. The generalisation of cashless payment marks more than just the hotel transaction system&#8217;s modernisation between hotel and customer. And it brings with it a series of benefits, which will improve staff management and, above all, the customer experience.</p>
<p><strong>OCCUPATION AND BRAND REINFORCEMENT</strong></p>
<p>The implementation of new payment systems leads to an increase in hotel occupancy and profits. The customer is motivated to consume hotel services almost on impulse, favored by the service&#8217;s greater agility.</p>
<p>This system also reverts to the benefit of the hotel and its publicity. You will reinforce your brand by participating in a new experiential way.</p>
<p><strong>MARKETING TOOL</strong></p>
<p>From the arrival of the client, at the time of check-in, the hotel will be able to obtain a lot of information in a simple way, such as what type of traveler consumes more or what is the hotel&#8217;s most requested product or what is its expense according to its origin.</p>
<p>It will be a significant information source for the occupancy metrics or establishment records and, consequently, optimize your results. The data collected in the system will allow you to carry out promotions tailored to your customers&#8217; demands.</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>The risk of loss or fraud is reduced by eliminating physical transactions and not operating with cash. Security expenses are also significantly reduced by requiring up to 10 times fewer security personnel to transport funds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In this sense, NFC technology offers another significant advantage: it does not need specific readers. Any mobile phone with NFC and the necessary application allows us to implement the system with all the security protocols&#8217; requirements.</p>
<p><strong>LOYALTY</strong></p>
<p>The greater variety and evolution of payment systems guarantee the highest customer satisfaction level after their stay at the hotel. This is one of the indicators of loyalty with a specific hotel brand.</p>
<p><strong>CUSTOMER ACCESS CONTROL</strong></p>
<p>Those responsible for the common areas (dining room, lobby bar&#8230;) will carry out a complete control of the clients&#8217; access to particular hotel facilities.</p>
<p><strong>THE CASHLESS SYSTEM: ADVANTAGES FOR THE GUEST</strong></p>
<p>The news in the tourism and hotel sector shows that the traveler&#8217;s trends or lead to integrate into the experiential demand. The client pays for a good hotel, but he wants to feel part of what happens at his destination. The new payment methods become part of that experience and bring a series of advantages to the customer.</p>
<p>Staff training and the implementation of new technologies in the sector are the two factors that greatly facilitate the relationship between client and hotel. The new payment methods become part of that experience and provide a series of advantages to the guest.</p>
<p><strong>PAYMENT WITHOUT CASH</strong></p>
<p>It is the fundamental change concerning the current predominant mode of payment through the POS card. When making your purchase, the customer will bring his bracelet to the waiter&#8217;s mobile phone, and the cashless system will allow his consumption to be paid with the cashless system. Drinks can be paid even from the pool, which will provide a lot of autonomy for both the hotel staff and the guest.</p>
<p><strong>ROOM OPENING</strong></p>
<p>Keys and magnetic cards will become part of history. Through NFC technology, the customer can access the room safely and quickly. Through your mobile or bracelet.</p>
<p><strong>RESERVATIONS OF SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES</strong></p>
<p>The client may, for example, make the reservation of activities, excursions, provide a wi-fi connection or access to restricted areas such as gym, spa, or conference rooms, or cost control for minors with the so-called kid-limit.</p>
<p><strong>ACCUMULATED EXPENSE</strong></p>
<p>The guests may accumulate expenses that will be paid at the end of the stay. They will be able to see their movements and download their final invoice at the time of their departure.</p>
<p>The evolution of the hotel sector replaces modernization and sets the pace according to customer demands and social changes. The definitive settlement of digitization is no longer a pending issue.</p>
<p>From<strong> IHCS</strong>, as an international hotel consultancy, we can provide you with the necessary support for staff training and the exemplary implementation of the digital system and the implementation of new management systems in your establishment.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Why do we date or live-in with someone before we marry them? It is because we want to make sure we are compatible and meant to be with them before making a lifelong commitment. We might call this a feasibility study. Building a hotel is also a commitment although of a different kind.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Researching, assessing, and conducting a feasibility study before committing yourself to a hotel project is not only a wise thing to do but also indispensable.</p>
<p>Whether you are an investor or in search of one, a feasibility study of the concerned hotel project and related investment is the point from where to begin.</p>
<h2><strong>What is a hotel feasibility study?</strong></h2>
<p>A hotel feasibility study is an analysis of a probable hotel building project to see if it would make for a sustainable and viable financial investment.</p>
<p>It will be an inquiry into the required amount of investment, financial determinants, expected revenue, rate of return of investment, market viability, and location study amongst other things.</p>
<p>At International Hotel Consulting Services, we provide you with a comprehensive and detailed hotel feasibility study including a thorough investigation of the project&#8217;s financial requirements and rate of return of investment in particular.</p>
<blockquote><p>Save your time, energy, and money while our consultants lay the groundwork for making sure you associate yourself with profitable hotel investments.</p></blockquote>
<h2><strong>What does a hotel feasibility study entail?</strong></h2>
<h3>Location Analysis</h3>
<p>Location is key when it comes to investing in hotel building projects. This is why an understanding and knowledge about the location and site of construction is necessary.</p>
<p>The location analysis also includes the geographical and topographical description, proximity from airports, tourist spots, and other popular locations.</p>
<p>Restrictions, rules, and regulations regarding construction such as height restrictions, etcetera in are also included.</p>
<h3>Market Review</h3>
<p>For clinching a profitable hotel deal, a knowledge of the existing market in the area is essential. At IHCS, with our extensive experience, we include a thorough study of the market exclusively for you.</p>
<p>The market review includes an update on competitors, current market trends and predictions. We conduct a thorough study of all these variables and guide our clients through the process of deciding the hotel profile, i.e. family hotel, rustic or gastronomic hotel, etc.</p>
<h3>Propose a brand strategy</h3>
<p>A well-structured brand strategy is a key ingredient in the recipe of success in hotel investment projects.   A promotional and sales strategy is an important determinant of the rate of investment returns. In order to plan your sales strategy, it might be worth gathering a team of sales professionals to see if they have any suggestions on how to bring sales in. Perhaps the hotel could even consider hosting an event to discuss sales tactics. There are some <a href="https://www.salesforce.com/blog/sales-kickoff-agenda-2020-sko/">sales kickoff agenda</a> items online to inspire the sales team. Hopefully, that will help them to come up with an effective strategy. </p>
<p> <P> </p>
<p>Professionals at IHCS provide outlines for a promotional brand strategy according to the scale of the project and trends of the market.</p>
<h3>Expenditure estimates / Financial feasibility analysis</h3>
<p>The mainstay of our expert services is our thorough analysis of an upcoming project&#8217;s financial feasibility.</p>
<p>Several factors have to be taken into consideration such as building costs which include the cost of land, construction costs, furnishing, equipment, maintenance and fixtures, electricity, water, and insurances among others. If you ultimately decide that you want to design and construct <a href="https://www.factorysteeloverstock.com/option-2/">custom metal buildings</a> to act as the overall structure of your hotel, then making sure that you have an accurate price for this particular type of project will be very important, as it could make all the difference when it comes to your finances. Non-building costs and soft costs such as staff salaries, staff training, advertising, and taxes.</p>
<p>We investigate all probable factors and arrive at conclusions on the technical and financial feasibility of a potential hotel project. Depending on the situation, we may even decide to carry out a <a href="https://earlygrowthfinancialservices.com/the-1-reason-you-need-a-startup-financial-model-and-7-others-good-reasons/">financial model</a> so we can charter costs and revenue projections that can be considered now, and at various times in the future. This will help to give everybody a better idea about their financial circumstances. The investment needed to execute the project as well as the return of investment are also ascertained by our team.</p>
<h3>ADR and Revpar Projections</h3>
<p>ADR (Average Daily Rate) and Revpar (Revenue Per Available Room) are trusted indicators to map the financial success of any hotel.</p>
<p>At IHCS our experts calculate ADR and Revpar projections for a proposed hotel based on the existing rates of other hotels in the area.</p>
<p>The ADR and Revpar projections will help you in monitoring the financial performance of a hotel project.</p>
<h3>Visitor Statistics</h3>
<p>A study of tourists visiting the area where you plan to build a hotel is crucial. The frequency of their arrival in the area during different parts of a year, tourist habits and preferences, and spending patterns are investigated by professionals at IHCS.</p>
<p>Based on research on the above-mentioned aspects we build a tourist profile which will further be used to determine various other aspects of the hotel such as prices of rooms and services.</p>
<h3>A study of labour</h3>
<p>At <a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">IHCS</a>, we undertake an analysis of the required human resources and labour and related factors. The availability of technicians and labourers, their sourcing, supply and quality is inquired into as a part of our feasibility study.</p>
<p>We also suggest solutions to labour oriented problems that could arise and prepare a layout for costs that have to be incurred for procuring labour including fee, transport, and accommodation. It&#8217;s why more hotels are using <a href="https://bmarkostructures.com/modular-hotels/">BMarko</a> modular structures or similar for the hotel, as this means that at the same time the foundations are being laid, other elements can be completed away from the site. This dramatically reduces the time to market as well as construction and labor costs.</p>
<h3>Rate Analysis</h3>
<p>This includes an investigation into supply and demand, rates and prices of hotels in the area where the hotel project is going to be established.</p>
<p>A study of their rates and services would the basis of making occupancy rate and prices projections for the proposed hotel. This investigation is essential for determining a potential project&#8217;s financial feasibility and stability.</p>
<h3>ROI (Return on Investment)</h3>
<p>The purpose of calculating the return on investment for a hotel construction project is to predict whether the said project would yield profits or losses.</p>
<p>The formula for calculating ROI is = (investment revenue-investment cost)/ investment cost. However, calculating ROI isn&#8217;t as simple as the formula. For an accurate ROI, the investment revenue and cost revenue have to be accurately estimated.</p>
<blockquote><p>IHCS professionals help you decide the financial feasibility of a hotel investment with accurate ROI calculations.</p></blockquote>
<h3>Internal Rate of Return</h3>
<p>Financial feasibility of investment is also determined by the internal rate of return of a project. It is the rate of return of investment which excludes external factors such as inflation.</p>
<p>An investment is considered to be viable if the IRR is either more than or equal to the cost of investment. If it turns out to be lower than the investment then the potential project is not deemed profitable.</p>
<p>Potential investors choose to make their investments depending on the IRR. Our team of experts calculate IRR after considering all the variables.</p>
<h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
<p>A competitive analysis of existing hotels in an area before venturing into constructing a new hotel next to them is very crucial. In addition to the rate analysis, ADR, and Revpar projections an in-depth competitive analysis of other hotels in the area is required.</p>
<p>Knowledge of the total number of existing and future competitors, the scope of their services, popularity, online reputation, star rating, target customers and market penetration are some of the aspects of a thorough competitive analysis.</p>
<p>For an extensive competitive analysis of local hotels, you can reach out to our professionals at IHCS.</p>
<h3>Identifying Revenue Resources</h3>
<p>Calculating and projecting expected revenue resources from a project is a prerequisite for gauging the financial feasibility of any project.</p>
<p>The primary revenue sources for any hotel are its room stays, food, beverage, and hosting events, conferences, meeting etc. Calculating the annual sales from these sources helps in arriving at estimated revenue costs.</p>
<p>The seemingly simple calculation of revenue resources requires expertise and experience which we are happy to offer at IHCS.</p>
<h2>How can we help you?</h2>
<p>We offer an exhaustive feasibility study for any hotel construction project around the world. Our painstaking investigations explore all possible risks and opportunities that can arise in this business venture.</p>
<p>At IHCS we strive to understand your vision and plans for a proposed hotel establishment and accordingly strategies a course of action for a feasibility study.</p>
<p>As elaborated above, we microscopically scrutinise every aspect of hotel construction including geographical factors, market analysis, building costs, finances, and expected returns.</p>
<blockquote><p>The hotel business industry is continuously evolving which is why it is prone to fluctuations and risks.</p></blockquote>
<p>Letting our expert and experienced professionals manoeuver a way out of these ever-changing dynamics will minimise the risks and maximise the benefits.</p>
<p>We kindly invite you to schedule a meeting with us for hotel investment consultation and solutions.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A <strong>hotel consultant</strong> is a professional that can provide a new approach to our hotel, helping us to enhance certain aspects related to the team or to certain aspects of the organisation as a whole.</p>
<p>We will analyse this issue in depth so that you can learn about their duties in detail.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">What can the presence of a hotel consultant bring to us?</h2>
<p><strong>Capturing customers: </strong>They will be in charge of implementing different strategies that will help us to capture customers, as well as retain them. They will also segment the market in order to be able to identify the most predisposed profile to visit our complex.</p>
<p><strong>Increased profitability: </strong>They will also study any type of aspect that is related to the hotel&#8217;s viability; including the management of payments, prices of services, appropriate hiring of staff, payment of taxes&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Positioning the brand on the Internet: </strong>The Internet is an important resource that will help the world to learn more about our hotel. For example, should we have a hotel in Lanzarote, we can position our page with the appropriate terms so that, when a customer wants to stay in that place, we will appear in the first positions. Given the importance of this aspect, the <strong>hotel consultant</strong> will have the appropriate knowledge needed to extend the brand throughout the network.</p>
<h3>What does a hotel consultant bring to a hotel?</h3>
<p>In addition to all the aspects we have mentioned in the previous section, we will now see more specifically how having a hotel consultant can benefit us.</p>
<h4>Identifies the technology that most suits the business</h4>
<p>Computerisation is key in hotels; a suitable software must be used to manage employee payrolls, customer details, payments, supplier agreements, as well as any other related aspect.</p>
<p>As there is a high quantity of hotel software existing on the market, choosing the most suitable one for us is not an easy task; a <strong>hotel consultant</strong> will have the appropriate knowledge, based on the type of hotel and its needs, to choose the most suitable technology.</p>
<h4>Adaptation to the market</h4>
<p>The truth is that the hotel sector is evolving at a very progressive rate, and it is very possible that your competition has overtaken you. Knowing how to go one step ahead will help us attract customers and strengthen the business.</p>
<p>A hotel consultant will be in tune with the latest changes; in this way, you can adapt to the market to achieve the best results.</p>
<h4>Better time management</h4>
<p>The vast majority of hotels waste time doing some manual tasks that could be automated. A <strong>hotel consultant</strong> will have the right tools to automate different processes; this will not only save time, it will also save money.</p>
<p>For all of these reasons, hiring a hotel consultant may be the best decision of your life, something that really will keep the business afloat or simply improve profits.</p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>Productivity is a factor that must be controlled in any business at all times and is that if a business ceases to be productive or we do something to turn the situation around, it will not fail to fail.</p>
<p>La entrada <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/blog/increase-hotel-productivity/">How Staff Can Increase Hotel Productivity</a> se publicó primero en <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com">IHCS</a>.</p>
]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hotel sector is working with increasingly tighter margins, and more aggressive competition is trying to get the better of us. That&#8217;s why it is important to squeeze the most out of resources and try to make more from less.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Can we improve the productivity of our team?</h2>
<p><strong>Before we look to staff to improve hotel productivity, we need to ask ourselves the following questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Have we defined what tasks each employee should complete on their shift? What tasks does each department have? Have we measured how long these tasks take and how much they cost?</li>
<li>Do we have the advanced management tools we need to control our business&#8217; activity?</li>
<li>Do we know what the business&#8217; &#8216;fat&#8217; is?</li>
</ul>
<p>By &#8216;fat&#8217; we mean the activities or behaviours that could slow staff down when completing their tasks, generating idle periods of time, bottlenecks, and repetitive tasks. In other words, it is the time that an employee does not have a specific task to do and spends it doing unproductive activities.</p>
<h3>Improving the hotel productivity by better managing shifts and flexibility</h3>
<p>Answering these questions is the first step you need to take before assessing if your planning is stable or if you should modify anything.</p>
<p>You need to determine <strong>the number of bookings you have</strong> and get an idea of the influx; these figures will indicate how many staff members you need on the team, and whether to include more or fewer shifts.</p>
<p>When we talk about flexibility, we&#8217;re referring to the dynamism related to assigning shifts and working hours to hotel employees, in accordance with the tasks foreseen.</p>
<p>The hotel does not have the solvency needed to always bear the same costs when it comes to paying staff wages. At times when there is more work, the costs associated with keeping staff are incredibly high.</p>
<p>To avoid this, <strong>flexi-time</strong> can be employed, where a given number of work hours are placed in a &#8216;bank&#8217; for busier periods, and employees are not required to work during quieter times. This &#8216;<strong>bank</strong>&#8216; helps keep a control, trying to ensure that the employee is productive during the period of time that they are contracted, paying them extra hours where necessary.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s important that the hotel works with advanced management tools to control everything mentioned above and assign tasks to employees, manage incidents and special working hours, etc.</p>
<p>With these key factors, our <strong>hotel productivity</strong> is improved thanks <a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/blog/staff-training/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>to good staff management</strong></a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you want your hotel to be full all year round, you can&#8217;t sit back twiddling your thumbs. A factor that we should examine is our staff&#8217;s qualifications, i.e. if employees have the right training, the customer will receive the service they are looking for, improving their overall experience and making it more likely that they are going to rely on our services again and speak well of our business.</p>
<p>These are just some of the reasons why we should invest in staff training.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>Why should you do staff training?</strong></h2>
<h3><strong>Experience</strong></h3>
<p>Satisfying customers is not enough anymore; we need to make them love us. If the hotel only thinks about being OK, and just passing the mark, we probably won&#8217;t get a negative review, but we won&#8217;t be getting a positive one either!</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s be honest, the customer probably won&#8217;t even remember your hotel.</p>
<p>You need to remember that they have probably visited several hotels over the year and if you want to stand out, it&#8217;s only logical that your employees need to have been trained correctly to improve the customer experience.</p>
<h3><strong>Information</strong></h3>
<p>So they know what the customer is asking for at all times, your employees need to be able to understand them. That&#8217;s where knowing more languages is always better when it comes to the &#8220;tourism&#8221; sector.</p>
<h3><strong>Managing bad reviews</strong></h3>
<p>A bad review can ruin your business. If we know the client&#8217;s exact problem, we can act on it immediately, stopping things from getting any worse.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why you should train your employs with protocols, sales techniques, event management, customer service, loyalty strategies and communication skills, environmental awareness, etc.</p>
<p>Thanks to this training, the worker will be able to manage strategies that improve the hotel&#8217;s reputation or any crisis that it may be faced with.</p>
<p>If the employee does not know how to respond to a complicated situation, this could spoil everything for the hotel.</p>
<h3><strong>Online channels</strong></h3>
<p>Given the number of offers that there are in the hotel sector, any added bonus is key to position yourself above your competitors. Having affordable packages is not enough, as we now need to do everything possible to promote them properly.</p>
<p>If you train your staff in online marketing, and other promotional techniques, your investment in advertising will be in the best hands.</p>
<h3><strong>The road to success</strong></h3>
<p>It&#8217;s no secret that a poorly managed company is set for failure. A hotel director must know about administration and business management among other areas and must retrain constantly given that this sector is always changing.</p>
<p>If we invest in training our employs, it makes it a lot easier for all of us to achieve the objectives that we set.</p>
<p>These are all the reasons why training staff is key, not just in the hotel industry, but for any type of business.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2 style="text-align: center;">Hotel communication: tips for improving it</h2>
<h3>Make your vision known</h3>
<p>In order to avoid confusion among the different employees, it will be crucial for each member of staff to know the mission and vision of the company. They must know both the short and long-term goals.</p>
<p>This will help them to be motivated, so they will feel more involved with the hotel.</p>
<h3>Training</h3>
<p>It is worth remembering that communication is a type of skill that must be learned. If you realise that there are significant problems with communication at your hotel, you should start thinking of offering training courses to the staff, so that they can overcome these barriers that could end with the business going bankrupt.</p>
<h3>Launch strategies that encourage teamwork</h3>
<p>Experts say that a good way of breaking the communication barriers is to launch initiatives to encourage our employees to work as a team. For example, we can create certain out-of-office events to improve trust among the employees and allow them to form close relationships.</p>
<h3>Constantly organise meetings</h3>
<p>In order to achieve an effective communication system at the company, this must be maintained regularly. This is why you should organise at least one meeting per week. The idea is for both yourself and your employees to get up-to-date with what is happening at the hotel.</p>
<p>We must take advantage of this moment to listen to any complaints and suggestions that they wish to convey to us.</p>
<h3>Reaction</h3>
<p>All companies have communication problems at any given time; either due to the inefficiency of management, incompetent employees or for any other reason. The biggest companies have learned to act on any abnormal sign, preventing it from going any further.</p>
<p>If you are prepared for what may happen and take the appropriate measures before everything gets worse, you will save the situation.</p>
<p>These strategies are key for improving communication at a hotel.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong><em>Adult only</em></strong> hotels have become a global trend. They emerged in Spain at the end of the last decade, with the feature of being designed so that we can enjoy time with our partner, to find tranquillity, luxury and pure relaxation.</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center;">Adult only hotels: the key feature</h3>
<p>According to statistics, the number of bookings at this type of accommodation have multiplied 3 times in recent years; therefore, we are talking about a tourism that interests people. This explains why the number of hotels dedicated to this sector have increased in such a way.</p>
<p>These hotels began to establish themselves on the market throughout the 70s, a time when &#8220;honeymoon&#8221; holidays reached their highest point.</p>
<p>For example, in the Caribbean there are some hotels with areas specially designed for adults, or those that only allow adults to stay. In Europe we can find these in countries such as Spain and Croatia; and in Asia, in Bali. Other hotel chains also offer the possibility to improve this adult only service by offering butlers, swimming pools and private beaches, double jacuzzis in the bedrooms, as well as exclusive access to VIP areas.</p>
<h3>All inclusive luxury: an option to make customers feel at home</h3>
<p>This option has been designed so that the customer has everything they are looking for with no restrictions; to feel as comfortable as they are at home, but with the same benefits offered to them by the resort.</p>
<p>The people who book these hotels are aged between 30 and 50 years; moreover, their family income is calculated to be approximately above €60,000.</p>
<p>Thus, unlike what is achieved at other hotels, the goal is not only to provide stays to the user, but also a customised experience. The customer who hires this service wants to customise it as they please; in doing so, the likelihood that they return will be much higher.</p>
<p>It is calculated that, to date, there are more than 140 hotels with an <strong><em>Adults Only</em></strong><em> </em>option throughout the market; of these, 74 are located in the Balearic Islands, another 30 in the Canary Islands and 20 in Mainland Spain. It is estimated that there will be a total of more than 600 establishments across the world. The vast majority of them are rather small, with facilities that do not suit children and have a very careful and strict decoration. An experience that will make us enjoy our holidays on a completely new level.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A <strong>hotel consultant</strong> is a <strong><a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/hotel-consulting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>professional</u></a> </strong>who is responsible for giving professional advice to investors or individuals who are interested in entering this business. They also provide support to hotels that are in operation.</p>
<p>Having a hotel consultant is actually very practical at all times: if the business is not going as well as expected, with their advice we can come out at the other side. However, even if it goes well, a hotel consultant may help us to prevent a crisis, as well as establish different strategies to consolidate and expand the brand on the market.</p>
<p>Even though they have been operating for some time, some hotels find it difficult knowing how to define their business model and the goals they want to accomplish. Different opportunities will arise, but they won&#8217;t know how to achieve them or what to do if they manage to obtain them. With a hotel consultant, they can identify the strong points of the hotel whilst connecting with any opportunities that arise or may arise.</p>
<p>We will now define the main duties of a <strong>hotel consultant</strong>.</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;">Main Duties Of A Hotel Consultant</h2>
<p>Prepare market studies.</p>
<p>Develop a project that adapts to the real needs of the market, as well as the location in which the hotel is placed.</p>
<p>Prepare feasibility studies for the project. This will determine whether the installation of a hotel is convenient, if it will be profitable, and other related matters.</p>
<p>They will also develop the Business Plan and Development Plan.</p>
<p>If the hotel is already in operation, the consultant may provide all the tools that allow it to organise processes, adapting to the customer&#8217;s demands at all times. To do this, they will use specialised programs in marketing and sales, operational hotel management, they will establish promotion strategies, as well as training and practice plans.</p>
<p>A <strong>hotel consultant</strong> will provide the hotel with a new look towards the market, helping the business to organise all its priorities and make all the relevant changes that will help it to become established as one of the best in the competitive market where it is situated.</p>
<p>With all of this we reiterate what we have already said: a hotel consultant is required one way or another, both if it is running well or if it is going through a bad time.</p>
