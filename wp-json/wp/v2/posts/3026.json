Thus, <b>the integration of hotel sustainability<\/b> must be a priority to guarantee the growth of the tourism industry, ensuring the preservation of the environment.<\/p>\n<p>WHY IS IT NECESSARY TO ACT URGENTLY?<\/p>\n<p>As the <b>World Tourism Organization (OMT)<\/b> points out<b>, &#8220;the principles of sustainability refer to the environmental, economic and socio-cultural aspects of tourism development<\/b> and they also state that an appropriate balance must be established between these three dimensions to guarantee its long-term sustainability&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">    <\/span><\/p>\n<p><i>All this is based on a common objective: the reduction of the carbon footprint and greenhouse gases.  <\/i><\/p>\n<p>So, <a style=\"color: blue;\" href=\"https:\/\/www.cooleffect.org\/why-carbon\">what are greenhouse gases<\/a> in terms of tourism? The data from the most recent studies indicate that tourism produces 5% of the total greenhouse effect emissions worldwide. As explained by<b> the Cambridge Institute for Sustainability Leadership<\/b>, it is expected to increase by 130% by 2035, so the implementation of sustainability measures in hotels is crucial.<\/p>\n<p>SOCIAL COMMITMENT TO PROMOTE HOTEL SUSTAINABILITY<\/p>\n<p><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">   <\/span>Society is more committed than ever to preserving the environment, which is why they are more willing to invest in sustainable tourism. A <b>survey conducted by the TUI group<\/b>, which showed that young people are the sector that most wants to bet on a sustainable hotel for holidays.<\/p>\n<p><i>Shifting hotel investment towards more environmentally friendly forms is presented as a long-term future commitment.<\/i><\/p>\n<p>OMT GENERAL LINES FOR HOTEL SUSTAINABILITY<\/p>\n<p>Following the OMT guidelines, a series of questions are established that must be fulfilled when making changes in hotel management whenever it concerns sustainability. The first one refers to the <b>optimization of environmental resources<\/b> for day-to-day work in the tourism industry.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  <\/span><\/p>\n<p>Second, <b>&#8220;the socio-cultural authenticity of the communities where tourism is framed must be respected.&#8221;<\/b> Regarding this aspect, it is important to highlight the importance of not breaking with the aesthetics of a territory by the inclusion of innovative elements. A balance must be found.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">  <\/span><\/p>\n<p>Finally, the OMT points out that economic activities derived from hotel sustainability <b>must provide employment opportunities for the inhabitants of the corresponding locality<\/b>, as well as income.<\/p>\n<p>\u00a0<\/p>\n<p>MEASURES TO ACHIEVE FULL HOTEL SUSTAINABILITY<\/p>\n<p>With the basis of the roadmap to be followed to implement sustainable measures, in the <b>Hotel Yearbook 2020<\/b>, Dr. Legrand, a sustainability expert, presents some ideas that are easily applicable that are becoming a trend.<\/p>\n<p>DO NOT WASTE FOOD<\/p>\n<p>Food production entails an environmental impact, which is why it is intended to establish <b>repurposing food menus<\/b> in the different hotel kitchens. Another option is to create your own organic gardens or buy in local markets to reduce your carbon footprint.<\/p>\n<p>MINIMIZE THE CONSUMPTION OF WATER AND ELECTRICITY<\/p>\n<p>By installing <b>water filter circuits <\/b>in showers, the consumption of this good can be substantially reduced. <b>The implementation of lighting sensors<\/b> also offers guarantees of electronic efficiency. Hotel Sustainability is a set of all these measures.<\/p>\n<p>REJECT THE PLASTIC<\/p>\n<p>An easy step in investing in hotel sustainability is to <b>substitute all single-use plastic products for reusable materials<\/b>, such as bamboo or glass. It is a measure that can be applied in water bottles, supplies of shampoo and gel, straws, utensils &#8230;<\/p>\n<p>SUSTAINABLE technology<\/p>\n<p>More and more hotels are investing in electronic devices to reduce paper consumption<b>. The centralization of documents in computerized databases<\/b> facilitates the reduction of consumption of this material.<\/p>\n<p>CHOOSE ZERO KILOMETER PRODUCTS AND MATERIALS<\/p>\n<p>Following the measure of promoting the development of the locality where the hotel is placed, the best option is zero kilometers. This section covers the <b>use of locally produced products and materials <\/b>so that not only profits are concentrated in the vicinity, but also pollution from transfers from more distant locations is reduced.<\/p>\n<p>COMMITMENT TO HOTEL SUSTAINABILITY<\/p>\n<p>If you are thinking about investing in sustainability, IHCS can help you. <b>Our <\/b><b>hotel investment management service<\/b><b> will help you to implement all the measures you <\/b>want so that you can grow as a reference in the tourism sector.
