THE EVOLUTION OF THE SECTOR CALLS FOR THE PROGRESSIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE START-UP AND OPTIMISATION OF CASHLESS PAYMENT, OR CASHLESS PAYMENT, AS THE MOST INNOVATIVE, QUICK AND ACCORDING TO NEW CUSTOMER DEMANDS.<\/p>\n<p><strong>WHAT IS CASHLESS? DEFINITION<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The cashless system, currently widespread in major events (concerts, fairs, amusement parks, festivals, etc.) consists of a cashless payment system with a virtual mode (mobile phone, digital watch, rechargeable wristbands) its virtual currency and through the so-called NFC technology.<\/p>\n<p>This NFC (Near Field Communication) platform is a wireless communication system designed to communicate two technological devices at a short distance.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>This platform, which does not necessarily have to be connected to the internet, allows the collection and exchange of data and making payments through our mobile phone and, consequently, the reduction of cash.<\/p>\n<p>In a changing society, the accommodation industry should integrate these new forms of economic transactions in hotel companies: New customers, new payment systems, which provide a series of advantages that we can see below.<\/p>\n<p><strong>THE CASHLESS SYSTEM: ADVANTAGES FOR THE HOTEL<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The implementation of the cashless system in the hotel sector seems unstoppable. The generalisation of cashless payment marks more than just the hotel transaction system&#8217;s modernisation between hotel and customer. And it brings with it a series of benefits, which will improve staff management and, above all, the customer experience.<\/p>\n<p><strong>OCCUPATION AND BRAND REINFORCEMENT<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The implementation of new payment systems leads to an increase in hotel occupancy and profits. The customer is motivated to consume hotel services almost on impulse, favored by the service&#8217;s greater agility.<\/p>\n<p>This system also reverts to the benefit of the hotel and its publicity. You will reinforce your brand by participating in a new experiential way.<\/p>\n<p><strong>MARKETING TOOL<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>From the arrival of the client, at the time of check-in, the hotel will be able to obtain a lot of information in a simple way, such as what type of traveler consumes more or what is the hotel&#8217;s most requested product or what is its expense according to its origin.<\/p>\n<p>It will be a significant information source for the occupancy metrics or establishment records and, consequently, optimize your results. The data collected in the system will allow you to carry out promotions tailored to your customers&#8217; demands.<\/p>\n<p><strong>SECURITY<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The risk of loss or fraud is reduced by eliminating physical transactions and not operating with cash. Security expenses are also significantly reduced by requiring up to 10 times fewer security personnel to transport funds.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">\u00a0<\/span><\/p>\n<p>In this sense, NFC technology offers another significant advantage: it does not need specific readers. Any mobile phone with NFC and the necessary application allows us to implement the system with all the security protocols&#8217; requirements.<\/p>\n<p><strong>LOYALTY<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The greater variety and evolution of payment systems guarantee the highest customer satisfaction level after their stay at the hotel. This is one of the indicators of loyalty with a specific hotel brand.<\/p>\n<p><strong>CUSTOMER ACCESS CONTROL<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Those responsible for the common areas (dining room, lobby bar&#8230;) will carry out a complete control of the clients&#8217; access to particular hotel facilities.<\/p>\n<p><strong>THE CASHLESS SYSTEM: ADVANTAGES FOR THE GUEST<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The news in the tourism and hotel sector shows that the traveler&#8217;s trends or lead to integrate into the experiential demand. The client pays for a good hotel, but he wants to feel part of what happens at his destination. The new payment methods become part of that experience and bring a series of advantages to the customer.<\/p>\n<p>Staff training and the implementation of new technologies in the sector are the two factors that greatly facilitate the relationship between client and hotel. The new payment methods become part of that experience and provide a series of advantages to the guest.<\/p>\n<p><strong>PAYMENT WITHOUT CASH<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>It is the fundamental change concerning the current predominant mode of payment through the POS card. When making your purchase, the customer will bring his bracelet to the waiter&#8217;s mobile phone, and the cashless system will allow his consumption to be paid with the cashless system. Drinks can be paid even from the pool, which will provide a lot of autonomy for both the hotel staff and the guest.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ROOM OPENING<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Keys and magnetic cards will become part of history. Through NFC technology, the customer can access the room safely and quickly. Through your mobile or bracelet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>RESERVATIONS OF SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The client may, for example, make the reservation of activities, excursions, provide a wi-fi connection or access to restricted areas such as gym, spa, or conference rooms, or cost control for minors with the so-called kid-limit.<\/p>\n<p><strong>ACCUMULATED EXPENSE<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>The guests may accumulate expenses that will be paid at the end of the stay. They will be able to see their movements and download their final invoice at the time of their departure.<\/p>\n<p>The evolution of the hotel sector replaces modernization and sets the pace according to customer demands and social changes. The definitive settlement of digitization is no longer a pending issue.<\/p>\n<p>From<strong> IHCS<\/strong>, as an international hotel consultancy, we can provide you with the necessary support for staff training and the exemplary implementation of the digital system and the implementation of new management systems in your establishment.<\/p>\n<div style=\"display: none;\"\n    class=\"kk-star-ratings kksr-valign-bottom kksr-align-center \"\n    data-id=\"2979\"\n    data-slug=\"\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars\">\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-inactive\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"1\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: 22px; height: 22px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"2\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: 22px; height: 22px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"3\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: 22px; height: 22px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"4\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: 22px; height: 22px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\" data-star=\"5\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: 22px; height: 22px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-stars-active\" style=\"width: 0px;\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: 22px; height: 22px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: 22px; height: 22px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: 22px; height: 22px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: 22px; height: 22px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n            <div class=\"kksr-star\">\n            <div class=\"kksr-icon\" style=\"width: 22px; height: 22px;\"><\/div>\n        <\/div>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n    <div class=\"kksr-legend\">\n            <span class=\"kksr-muted\"><\/span>\n    <\/div>\n<\/div>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>ADAPTATION TO THE DIVERSITY OF PAYMENT MEANS HAS BECOME A SUBJECT OF HUGE IMPORTANCE IN HOTEL MANAGEMENT.
