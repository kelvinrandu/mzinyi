<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">During the hotel development, one of the most important factors is to maintain a healthy balance of investment and hotel location. Being a hotel owner in Vietnam, you must remain aware of the fact that you once have to make the decisions regarding hotel size, hotel location, and amenities, and it will felt forever.

Also, it will have a positive impact on the economy of the country. </span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Creating flexible relationships with vendors</b></span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">Vendors are the people or the companies that offer a particular thing or product for sale. For the positive growth of the hospitality industry, it is necessary to develop a flexible relationship with the vendors. You might get surprised to know that one of the largest bundles of the cost that the hotel owner gets comes from the vendors. These vendors can be companies that provide cleaning products for the hotel, or they can be your hotel&#8217;s website developers. For coping with the rapidly changing technology, it is necessary to maintain a healthy and flexible relationship with these people. IHCS has made the Vietnamese hotel industry think twice about this factor, and it is one of the major reasons behind their positive growth in this sector in such a limited duration. </span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Ensuring labor loyalty</b></span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">One of the major factors that affect hotel sector business is labor loyalty. The profitability factor gets affected by the expense of hiring the labor.

<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Healthy consumer relationships</b></span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">Various feasibility studies have proved that the digital transformation of the world has completely changed the perspective of the hotel development sector. The majority of the marketing and sales details are now handled digitally. Therefore, for the best outcomes, one must install new digital systems that not only speed up the process but also help in maintaining healthy consumer relationships. IHCS is helping the hospitality sector in Vietnam in this concern. We are providing complete details regarding the newly built and functional digital systems that will make sales super fast and attract more guests than before. Also, with the help of this, the sector will be able to maintain a healthy relationship with its consumers. </span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Investment in technology</b></span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">With the rapid growth in technology, it is necessary for any business area to stay competitive. Nowadays, there is no need for the &#8220;search &amp; select hotel operators&#8221; process. Everything can be done digitally. If you keep on following the older footsteps and try to exempt the technology factor from your list while the development of hotels, then you will surely get no reward afterward. Everyone around the globe wants to enjoy the benefits of new technology, so in order to compete, you must have all the latest systems at your hotel and in your country.

<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Promoting the growth of soft-brand hotels</b></span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">You must be thinking about what soft brand hotels are. Well, these are the signature hotels or the ones that are individual names and affiliated with some major national level franchise. Promoting the growth of these types of hotels will have a positive impact on the profit factor of the country that it is gaining from the hotel sector because by promoting these hotels, the country&#8217;s national franchise distribution system will also be promoted. IHCS has let the Vietnam government and tourists sector to focus on this factor for the betterment of the country. Also, these hotels have the highest occupancy rate, so it will definitely be in favor of the country in this way also. </span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Promoting customer freedom</b></span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">With the betterment of technology and society, consumers nowadays are more educated and sophisticated as compared to what they were around a decade ago. Years ago, there are very few travelers to the country that understand the differences among various hotel brands. However, it&#8217;s not the case now. As now, consumers are more knowledgeable, and they know their rights well; therefore, the best way is to provide them every type of freedom they desire. IHCS plays also a significant role in this cause for the Vietnam hotel development sector. </span></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The major international hoteliers <strong>believe in and are committed to </strong><a href="https://es.statista.com/estadisticas/664551/sector-hotelero-revpar-oriente-medio-y-africa/">growth in the Middle East</a>, after the different setbacks experienced by the tourism industry as a result of political instability in early 2011. Among other things, the Middle East <strong>is preparing for an increase in the number of hotel projects located inside shopping malls.</strong> The trend in tourism is to cater to consumers with great purchasing power from the Persian Gulf and South Asia, as they have a large amount of disposable income and enormous interest in shopping at large shopping malls, which are also on the rise. Most shopping malls are equipped with the latest technologies like edge computing, which can be argued to be a result of excellent <a href="https://vantiq.com/what-is-edge-computing/">research by the staff of Vantiq</a> and other similar companies that expertise in digital systems. When applied to shopping and retail businesses, edge computing can enhance customer experience; determine customer trends; and improve operational efficiency. As such, it is one of the best ways to get customers back to shopping in stores again. This is turning into the key to the recovery of tourism in the area.</p>
<p><strong>The United Arab Emirates has the most number of hotels under construction in the region</strong>, with a total of 70 hotels and 21,238 rooms. It also has the largest portfolio of planned hotel projects, with more than 36,000 rooms in 92 hotels. In addition, huge contracts to build hotels have already been awarded in Dubai in recent years. <strong>Saudi Arabia</strong> is particularly noteworthy, with <strong>religious tourism as a key factor</strong>. It is one of the emerging hotel markets with large construction projects underway.</p>
<p><strong>Qatar</strong> is one of the main markets and ranked third in terms of the number of hotels in the region, with 19 hotels and 5,544 rooms under construction. But its portfolio of hotel projects is expected to grow quickly in order to have more than 60,000 new rooms in time for the <strong>2022 World Cup</strong>.</p>
<p>At present, there is a large number of <a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/es/blog/presencia-internacional-de-los-hoteles-como-se-consigue/">hotel and residential projects </a>which will be built in the coming decade. <strong>Oman</strong><strong>&#8216;</strong><strong>s</strong> growing hotel industry-despite its relatively small market in comparison to others-has great potential and a very strong outlook in the planning stages. In <strong>Mascat</strong> alone, 5,000 hotel rooms will be built over the next 4 years. In contrast, <strong>Bahrain</strong>, which suffered from the effects of political instability, seemed to have made a slight recovery at the end of 2012, although ongoing uncertainty still casts doubts on the future of the hotel rooms under construction.</p>
<p>Another aspect worth pointing out is that <strong>luxury brands in the motor and fashion industries are trying to enter the hotel market.</strong> The latest example is Lamborghini, which plans to open 40 5-star hotels over the coming years.</p>
<p><strong>North Africa is another market with great potential in the international hotel industry.</strong> Data shows that there are more than 24,125 rooms under construction or in the planning stages. <strong>Egypt</strong> has the largest portfolio with more than 11,695 hotel rooms being planned or already under construction. Unrest affected the arrival of tourists in Egypt, which fell by 36% in 2012. Despite the protests, hoteliers remain optimistic in the medium and long term as Egypt is a market that usually manages to recover quickly. Likewise, <strong>Libya</strong> also expects a boom of new hotel projects, with 2,604 rooms currently being planned or under construction.</p>
<p><strong>What are Middle Eastern tourists like?</strong></p>
<p>Tourists from the Middle East are the<strong> best guests</strong> staying at hotels. They are the ones who spend the most. And this was the case for 2015. Once again, they were the travelers who spent the most per night: an average of €179. This was what the latest Hotel Price Index report showed after analyzing up to 40 destinations.</p>
<p>These tourists were not only the ones who spent the most at hotels, but in terms of growth, they were also the ones who <strong>increased their average expenditure the most</strong>-26% in comparison to 2014, when they spent €142 per night.</p>
<p><strong>This portfolio of hotel guests and projects in the region will offer attractive opportunities over the coming years.</strong> But their success will largely depend on political stability, especially in Arab countries.</p>
