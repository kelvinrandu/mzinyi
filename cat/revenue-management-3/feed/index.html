										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>HOTEL REVPAR IS CONSIDERED THE MOST IMPORTANT METRIC IN THE HOTEL INDUSTRY. tHE REVENUE PER AVAILABLE ROOM IS ESTABLISHED AS THE INDEX THAT VALUES THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF A CHAIN ​​OR ESTABLISHMENT.</p>
<p>This indicator measures the profitability generated by the rooms, in other words, it shows us the number of rooms that were occupied and how much was received by each of them. Below we will look at the appropriate strategies to increase our hotel&#8217;s RevPAR and, consequently, increase our profits.</p>
<p>As a professional performance indicator, RevPAR is critical in the hospitality industry. This ratio allows us to know with precision the financial reality of the establishment we manage.</p>
<p>RevPAR can be used by hotel owners to adjust hotel rates in order to maximize revenue or even as a tourism promotion formula.</p>
<p>It is essential to know what is the minimum RevPAR that must be achieved to obtain benefits in your accommodation in order to establish a <b>revenue management</b> <b>strategy</b> suited to your needs according to the characteristics of the establishment.</p>
<p><b>WHAT IS REVPAR HOTELS AND WHAT DOES IT MEAN?</b></p>
<p>As with other hotel occupancy metrics parameters that we have had the opportunity to discuss in previous articles on hotel management, RevPAR may not even sound familiar to you if you are not closely related to the accommodation industry.</p>
<p>In terms of <b>hotel accounting</b>, this index is calculated taking into account the number of rooms and will evaluate the financial performance of a hotel, calibrating the benefits obtained per room and always referring to a certain period of time, such as a week, a month or per year.</p>
<p><b>The RevPAR calculation</b> is simple: RevPAR, or revenue per available room, is a performance metric in the hotel industry that is calculated by dividing a hotel&#8217;s total guest-room revenue by the room count and the number of days in the period being measured.</p>
<p>How to determine if this result is correct? There are mechanisms to improve it and you can certainly do that.</p>
<p>But the interpretation of these indexes is not always straightforward. In an environment of such complexity as the hotelier, owners and managers perceive the need for an advisory service to solve several problems that affect the results of hotel management. At IHCS we have the necessary tools to identify the needs, the technological mechanisms we have and the right strategies within the scope of the concept of hotel revenue management to obtain the best accounting results.</p>
<p><b>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT TO KNOW MY HOTEL&#8217;S REVPAR?</b></p>
<p>Some of the fundamental axes are:</p>
<p>• <b>Control of results</b> in our hotel management. Thanks to this metric we can determine if the commercial strategy used for a season is giving the desired results or if changes are necessary.</p>
<p><b>• Revenue indicator</b>. RevPAR gives the team responsible for managing the tourism company&#8217;s finances an estimate of the income that the establishment will have in the coming months.</p>
<p>• Thanks to RevPAR, it is possible to know how far or near a hotel is reaching the ideal conditions of profitability.</p>
<p><b>HOW CAN WE IMPROVE REVPAR HOTELS?</b></p>
<p>The RevPAR Hotels index is part of the Revenue Management strategies, which aim to optimize the revenue of our hotel and obtain the highest possible profitability. Well, to improve the results we must consider two fundamental keys, such as the combination of our human resources and the exhaustive knowledge and satisfaction of our target client.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s see in detail.</p>
<p>•<b> Knowledge of the client&#8217;s profile: </b>in order to implement Revenue Management market strategies, it is necessary to have knowledge of your client. You can use tools like Google Analytics and other Big Data tools to discover everything about your potential customers and act accordingly.</p>
<p><b>• Loyalty program</b>. A satisfied customer will always be the best ambassador for your accommodation. He himself will attract others, and so on; increasing revenue and, consequently, profits.</p>
<p>• <b>Customer experience.</b> Customers&#8217; interests have changed and so have their preferences and habits. Customers don&#8217;t mind paying more if they know that they will receive good service in all aspects of their stay: from the staff&#8217;s attention to the state of the facilities. It is about valuing a global experience. The customer notices all the details such as bad Wi-Fi or air conditioning. In that case, he will negatively evaluate the room and his entire stay.</p>
<p>• The presence of trained professionals in all departments will be a guarantee for the client.</p>
<p>• <b>Technologic solutions.</b> Today there are all kinds of tools that can help you with hotel management. These strategies will serve not only to optimize rates, but also to improve the overall customer experience.</p>
<p>To implement all these improvement strategies, it is not always enough to raise prices. Before making decisions like this, carefully study what your guests are looking for. Get some advice for better results. At IHCS, as a hotel consultant, we provide you with the necessary mechanisms to optimize your results and obtain financial performance. You will get the results you desire.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>The hospitality industry plays a major role in economic activity, and accounting is managed by departments, based on the USALI</strong> (Uniform System of Accounts for the Lodging Industry). This instrument divides a hospitality business into eight departments: four operational and four functional (depending on whether services are provided directly to guests), and costs are distributed and allocated to these departments.</p>
<p>Today, <strong>the hospitality industry constantly needs sufficient information in order to make decisions and optimize operations</strong>. Once financial results are available, key performance indicators take center stage. These indicators determine the management efficiency of the costs, expenses and variables that affect how sales are made and the profitability of a hotel business. <strong>Hotel operations management changes the organization’s structure and the system of roles and duties</strong>. It also affects employee training, technology and the introduction of technical and strategic innovations.</p>
<p><strong>The fundamental purpose of hotel </strong><a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/es/blog/analisis-operacional-como-se-puede-mejorar-la-gestion-estrategica-de-tu-hotel/"><strong>operations management</strong></a><strong> is knowing how to properly use resources and capabilities to achieve specific operational and financial results</strong>. The targets must be specific, quantifiable, measurable and, above all, aligned with the hotel’s possibilities, its positioning in the market and in terms of competitors, its potential, and its prospects for the short, medium and long term.</p>
<p><strong>The importance of performing an operations analysis involves having an overall perspective and looking beyond</strong>. This analysis can be used to define fixed and variable costs and estimated profits by level of sales, based on the state of the hotel business. It aims to diagnose and evaluate the operational and financial results of hotel management.</p>
<p><strong>What ratios are used the most in the hospitality industry?</strong></p>
<p>The main purpose of these ratios is to help the hospitality industry make decisions and improve profitability. The most important, ADR (Average Daily Rate) and RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room), are defined in detail below:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>ADR (Average Daily Rate)</strong>: Average daily rate per occupied room. In other words, this is the average price for which the room is sold. (Room revenue / Occupied rooms).</li>
<li><strong>REVPAR (Room Revenue Per Available Room)</strong>: As one of the most commonly used indicators, it measures the revenue per available room. (Room revenue / Available rooms).</li>
<li><strong>TREVPAR (Total Revenue Per Available Room)</strong>: This differs from REVPAR because it takes into consideration room revenue as well as all the potential revenue generated by a room. This indicator is used at establishments where clients tend to spend more on services such as spas, casinos, etc. (Total revenue / Available rooms).</li>
<li><strong>GOPPAR (Gross Operating Profit Per Available Room)</strong>: This is the gross operating profit per available room. (Gross room revenue / Available rooms).</li>
<li><strong>REVPAG (Room Revenue Per Available Guest)</strong>: This refers to the room revenue per available guest and is increasingly used based on the need to segment the market and quantify customer loyalty. (Room revenue / Available guests).</li>
<li><strong>TREVPAG (Total Revenue Per Available Guest)</strong>: This differs from REVPAR because it takes into consideration total revenue as opposed to just room revenue. (Total revenue / Available guests).</li>
<li><strong>GOPPAG (Gross Operating Proﬁt Per Available Guest)</strong>: This is the gross operating profit per available guest. (Gross room revenue / Available guests).</li>
</ul>
<p>Improved <a href="https://www.hosteltur.com/126429_startups-no-perder-vista-2018-eficiencia-operativa.html"><strong>operational and financial results</strong></a> are directly linked to how the aforementioned ratios are used. In summary, <strong>a good operations analysis is essential in order to have an overview of every hotel department, estimate occupancy levels and thoroughly understand the establishment’s needs.</strong></p>

					<description><![CDATA[<p>In today’s competitive setting, hotels are becoming increasingly aware of the positive results obtained through the advice and contributions of consulting firms. Hotel owners and managers are asking themselves much more frequently whether they are making the most of future demand, their financial yield is appropriate or they are attracting the customers with the most potential.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The services provided by consulting firms <strong>specifically target hotel owners and managers who at some point in their career feel the need to obtain assistance or advice in addressing an array of problems and implementing continuous improvement processes</strong>. Therefore, the fundamental goal is to recommend viable solutions and to implement appropriate measures aimed at increasing the hotel&#8217;s productivity and competitiveness.</p>
<p>Before making any decisions and taking action, a number of processes and objectives must first be considered. <strong>The consulting firm must identify the needs, the areas for improvement, the technological tools available, and how to move forward</strong>. As far as the financial aspects, hotel owners and managers have and will continue to have more freedom in deciding what to do with their inventory and prices. Of course, they can always receive financial advice from their financial advisors, who they may have sought out after attending their financial seminar (<a href="https://www.leadjig.com/financial-seminar-marketing/">check it out</a> here) to help them come to a conclusion about whether their financial strategy is working in their favour or not. The outcome could determine how successful your hotel will be in the long run. Most are focused on achieving the highest occupancy possible and would rather fill the hotel than sell their rooms at a slightly higher price.</p>
<p>We already know that<strong>  </strong><a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/blog/how-to-implement-a-proper-strategy-for-revenue-management-in-hotels/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>revenue management</strong></a><strong>  strives to improve a hotel establishment&#8217;s current pricing strategy through the use of an automated system</strong>. This system has expanded significantly in recent years and its development has shown exponential growth, in line with technological advances. However, despite the number of years that revenue management has existed in the hotel industry, there continue to be a number of false myths or inaccurate ideas about it , so a strong knowledge base is essential.</p>
<p>The <strong>benefits of hiring a professional hotel consulting firm</strong> to  <strong>stimulate a hotel&#8217;s financial yield</strong> can be summarized as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Using new financial measurement criteria and operational instruments.</li>
<li>Analyzing the standard team operations, philosophy and corporate mission to ensure they are aligned.</li>
<li>Applying strategies to boost revenue, yield management techniques and operating cost management.</li>
<li>Focusing on the details and identifying the fundamental keys in establishing the loyalty of potential customers.</li>
<li>Providing access (and adjusting) to new technologies, markets and challenges.</li>
<li>Lowering costs and increasing the return on investment.</li>
<li>Taking into consideration indicators such as RevPar (revenue per available room), one of the most important indicators for hotel owners and managers.</li>
<li>Defining the company&#8217;s strengths and weaknesses, its resistance to change, how it operates as a hotel system, and the criteria needed for its corporate and financial health.</li>
<li>Obtaining an impartial and innovative perspective for problem solving.</li>
<li>Establishing a program to implement continuous improvement processes and solutions, and putting into practice the suggested solutions.</li>
<li>Applying upselling and cross-selling techniques, along with a good online marketing and social media strategy. These items are extremely effective at increasing a hotel&#8217;s revenue as well as improving product quality and guest satisfaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>The  <strong>opportunities of Big Data, improvements to technology, descriptive analysis methods and more extensive revenue management training</strong> have generated a great deal of interest in the industry towards this field.</p>
<p><strong>How does a hotel consulting firm help us obtain investors for new projects?</strong></p>
<p>When considering a new project, a consulting firm can help you create a solid business plan and then find the  <strong>investors</strong>  that are needed to  <strong>make a new project a reality or to improve an existing project.</strong></p>
<p>In summary, it is important to be surrounded by experienced professionals who help us collect the necessary information so it can then be analyzed properly. One of the aims of consulting firms is to  <strong>identify the most attractive hotel assets</strong>  along with those that best fit the type of investments we are making.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Revenue Management </strong>is formed by the word “revenue” and the word “management”. Though there is a Spanish translation, <strong>gestión de ingresos,</strong> the English term is used as is in the hotel sector.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS IT?</strong></p>
<p>Revenue Management consists of <strong>selling the right product at the right price at the right time to the right client through the right distribution channel.</strong> This set of techniques, whose main manifestation is price discrimination according to demand, arose in the airline sector at the end of the ‘70s. Today, it is successfully used in the hotel sector, mainly leading to an increase in the hotel’s revenue. In RM, it is necessary to work on key points of the company, such as segmentation, product definition, pricing strategy, competitive analysis, demand forecasting, and management of distribution channels. Ultimately, the <strong>aim is to optimise and increase our hotel’s revenue</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT CHARACTERISTICS DO HOTEL COMPANIES WHO USE RM HAVE?</strong></p>
<p>All the companies have <strong>similar characteristics</strong>. We’re talking about:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-size: 21px;"><strong>Fixed Capacity</strong></li>
<li style="font-size: 21px;"><strong>Perishable Inventory</strong></li>
<li style="font-size: 21px;"><strong>High fixed costs and low marginal sales costs: </strong>It is essential to know the importance of your costs (both fixed and variable) as part of Revenue Management strategies.</li>
<li style="font-size: 21px;"><strong>Possibility of segmenting demand</strong></li>
<li style="font-size: 21px;"><strong>Advance product sales</strong></li>
<li style="font-size: 21px;"><strong>Seasonal Demand</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>WHAT METRICS ARE WE USING?</strong></p>
<p>Normally, hoteliers focus on occupation or on average price, though the majority choose occupation as a point of reference. The metric that is really going to reflect if we are generating more or less revenue is the<strong> RevPAR ratio, which is always measured in monetary units.</strong> This ratio is the combination of occupation and <a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/blog/what-to-do-to-improve-the-average-price-of-our-hotel/">average price</a>, that’s to say, revenue per available room.</p>
<p>RevPAR attempts to balance these two variables. There are two methods of calculating it, yielding the same result in both cases. On the one hand, we can multiply the occupancy ratio by the average price. On the other hand, we can divide revenue from accommodation by available, unoccupied rooms.</p>
<p><strong>COMPONENTS OF RM</strong></p>
<p>Within Revenue Management, it is important to take into account a set of components in order to increase our revenue.</p>
<p>Firstly:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-size: 21px;"><strong>Demand Forecasting:</strong> This is the key component. It’s that uncertainty there is between the reservation date and the date of the client’s arrival. Therefore, it’s necessary to think ahead so that we can optimise fixed capacity. <strong>This helps predict demand behaviour with the goal of optimising inventory and prices, maximising revenue growth.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The rest of the components are different topics that RM also focuses on. They are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li style="font-size: 21px;"><strong>Product: </strong>Product definition, product diversification to be able to segment the price.</li>
<li style="font-size: 21px;"><strong>Segmentation:</strong> Who our clients are.</li>
<li style="font-size: 21px;"><strong>Price:</strong> What price we assign to each product for each client. In other words, the price based on demand behaviour that allows for optimisation of the hotel’s capacity.</li>
<li style="font-size: 21px;"><strong>Competition: </strong>Know who our competitors are, as this sector is more and more competitive each day. For this, we must define our “Competitive Set.” This set is chosen based on location, services, quality, brand, type of product, and price range. A very practical way to determine who our competitors are is to log on to Booking or TripAdvisor and see the hotels that they consider to be competitors based on what clients have searched for. To monitor the competition, there is another tool called Benchmarketing. This tells us what type of products are sold, what price they are sold at, what channels they are sold on, what my clients think of my competition, and more.</li>
<li style="font-size: 21px;"><strong>Distribution: </strong>Nowadays, control of all distribution channels is very important not only for increasing revenue, but also for increasing profits. There are certain tools that work as “Channel Managers”. With these, you register all the rooms and all the channels you work with and in just one click, you can lower or raise rates.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Revenue Management also includes “Total Revenue Management”.</strong> That’s to say, applying RM not only to the hotel rooms, but also to other spaces such as golf courses, restaurants, and more.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As we mentioned in our last article about <a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/blog/what-to-do-to-improve-the-average-price-of-our-hotel/">What to do to improve </a><a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/blog/what-to-do-to-improve-the-average-price-of-our-hotel/">the average price of our hotel? </a>(only availiable in Spanish) where we introduced the concept of hotel Revenue Management, this time we&#8217;ll talk about Revenue Management culture in general, focusing on how to implement the right step by step strategy to get the best results.</p>
<h2><strong>The origins of Revenue Management: Sabre</strong></h2>
<p>We begin with the origins of Revenue Management, which date back to the <strong>70s-80s within the aviation industry. </strong>Revenue Management appears primarily due to two reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>The deregulation of air traffic</li>
<li>The appearance of the GDS <em>(Global Distribution System).</em></li>
</ul>
<p>The father of Revenue Management culture was the general director (at that time) of <em>American Airlines,</em> Mr. Robert Crandall. It was he who began to offer those seats that he believed would not sell at cheaper prices. What was sought was being <strong>able to compete with low-cost airlines and increase profit margins.</strong></p>
<p>At the same time in the early 70s, <em>American Airlines </em>created <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sabre" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sabre, </a>a new computerized booking system. In the middle of that decade,<strong> more than 75 travel agencies </strong>were already<strong> connected.</strong> In this way, they saved telephone and telex costs.</p>
<p>From that moment, and in order to compete with Sabre, <em>United Airlines</em> created Apollo, while B<em>ritish Airways, Alitalia, KLM </em>and <em>Swissair </em>designed <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galileo_CRS">Galileo</a>. Finally, <em>Lufthansa</em>, <em>Iberia </em>and <em>Air France </em>invented the system <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amadeus_IT_Group">Amadeus</a>.</p>
<p>Posteriormente, estos sistemas de reservas se fueron implementando en otros tipos de servicios como por ejemplo, alquiler de coches y hoteles.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>What does Revenue Management mean exactly?</strong></h2>
<p>In short, it is management applied to the optimisation of revenue. Basically, it is <strong>a set of techniques that analyse the market, the product, the demand and seeks to influence consumer behaviour</strong> in order to maximize the benefits of the hotel.</p>
<p>In this section, I would like to make one comment. I would like to refer to the difference between Revenue Management and Yield Management, as these terms are often confused, so I think it is important to clarify them.</p>
<p>In my opinion, Yield Management is a technique (less developed) within the culture of Revenue Management. As we mentioned, the rationale of Revenue Management is simply achieving greater long-term profitability.</p>
<p>How? Just <strong>selling the right product to the right customer at the right price, at the right time and through the most appropriate channel.</strong></p>
<p>This valuable strategy should always be <strong>focused on customer satisfaction.</strong> In this way, optimization will last longer. I would also like to add that all departments should be involved in the strategy, otherwise effectiveness will be almost non-existent.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2><strong>Revenue Management strategy in hotels. Key steps.</strong></h2>
<h2><img class="wp-image-1186 size-thumbnail alignright" alt="Revenue managment total, estrategia paso a paso" width="270" height="152" /></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Analysis of the situation</strong>. The status of our establishment, our competition, demand, market or destination.</li>
<li><strong>Making decisions</strong>. After being informed of our current situation, we have to make the decision (we must know what we want).</li>
<li><strong>Strategy implementation. </strong>After setting our goal and steps to follow. We must start with implementation. It is very important to get the whole hotel team involved here.</li>
<li><strong>Assessment</strong>. Assessment must be constant, always evaluating the effectiveness of actions / strategies implemented. We must know whether we are fulfilling the goals we had set ourselves.</li>
<li>Feedback. For feedback to be effective, and constantly improving, it has to happen in all directions. All equipment, regardless of rank, must be part of the process.</li>
</ul>
<p><u>Key ratios used to compare results</u></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>RevPAR</strong>. Accommodation revenue per rooms available.</li>
<li><strong>TrevPAR</strong>. Total revenue per rooms available.</li>
<li><strong>GopPAR</strong>. Gross operating profit per available room.</li>
<li><strong>RevPAG</strong>. Accommodation revenue per guests available.</li>
<li><strong>TrevPAG</strong>. Total revenue per guests available.</li>
<li><strong>RevPASH</strong>. Revenue (used in bars and restaurants) per available seat and time unit.</li>
<li><strong>RevPAM</strong>. Revenue (used in spaces dedicated to events) per square meter available.</li>
<li><strong>RevPATI</strong>. Revenue per unit of inventory. It can be used in different ways, you just have to adapt the formula.</li>
</ul>
<h2><strong>Total Revenue Management, the right strategy</strong></h2>
<p>All staff should be trained, motivated and encouraged in participating in the meetings held periodically. From here, we can start talking about the total Revenue Management.</p>
<p>The Revenue Management <strong>should not only be applied to rooms. </strong>There are many other services and / or products to which a good Revenue Management strategy helps make a difference, as long as they positively impact on income statements.</p>
<p>These services and products are heavily dependent on the type of hotel in which we are working. As examples we can mention restaurants, Spas, meeting rooms, payment activities for animation teams, etc.</p>
<p>Finally in this section, it is important to note that when it comes to setting goals by department, we must be very careful <strong>not</strong> to <strong>create targets that may represent a conflict of interest between departments. </strong>This would have a negative impact in achieving the overall objective of the establishment concerned.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the lack of involvement and training of all staff, together with the lack of an objective or conflicting goals, usually creates two scenarios, frequently seen in some hotels. These being victims of a poor implementation of the Revenue Management culture.</p>
<p>We hope you enjoyed this short article and hopefully it will help improve the implementation of Revenue Management culture and a better profitability of your establishment. Always thinking in your customers satisfaction and engaging / training the whole team of your hotel or resort.</p>

]]></description>
										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The task of <strong>monitoring and increasing the average price</strong> is a task that must be followed carefully by the manager or hotel director. Of course, to achieve this efficiently, it is essential to always involve the entire hotel team.</p>
<p>Today there are many tools and strategies to significantly improve our income on accommodation. These <strong>techniques</strong> go far beyond simply increasing the average price, and in this article we will mention some of them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>What can we do to improve our average price?</h2>
<p>First things first: the <strong>hotel website</strong> (in this section, I suggest you read our article on <a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/blog/what-should-have-our-hotels-web-design-to-be-efficient/">how to efficiently design the hotel&#8217;s website</a> and another one about <a href="https://www.ihcshotelconsulting.com/blog/reservation-center-how-to-work-with-them-and-not-for-them/">booking engines for the website</a>).</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the website is the most profitable channel for any establishment, we say profitable mainly because, by selling from our own channel, <strong>we save on paying commissions</strong> to intermediaries. It is therefore very important to invest time and resources in this valuable distribution channel.</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Increased sales through our website will result in: </span></p>
<ul>
<li>A <strong>positive impact on income statement.</strong></li>
<li>A <strong>higher cash flow</strong> and reduction of our credit, thus minimizing risks.</li>
<li>Improvement in profitability per room or <strong>GopPar</strong> (Gross operating profit per available room).</li>
<li>An improvement when selling additional services of the hotel, helping to <strong>increase our Trevpar</strong> (Total revenue per available room).</li>
<li>Help to create a <strong>good database</strong> and thus facilitate the work of the person responsible for the CRM.</li>
<li>In many cases, it helps us to speed up the check-in process.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Social networks and internet communications</h2>
<p>Today it is almost <strong>vital to have a presence in social networks</strong>, as well as a strategy for managing them. Facebook and Twitter are important, but do not forget about the many other channels, including TripAdvisor, Foursquare, YouTube and local websites or blogs.</p>
<p>Internet communication takes place everywhere, so you need to ensure that someone is always monitoring the different customer-company contact channels. Even in small hotels, revenue managers often do not have time to control the media, so in the coming years the role of community manager will become a basic need. Whoever does not take advantage over social networking to the benefit himself will clearly be at a disadvantage before his competitors.</p>
<h2></h2>
<h2>Online reputation</h2>
<p>We must pay <strong>special attention to our online reputation</strong>, especially considering that social networks affect the buying behaviour of people, being important for 51% of the reserves.</p>
<p>Some facts to consider according to TripAdvisor&#8217;s <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.es/TripAdvisorInsights" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TripBarometer</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>93% of travellers around the world say that valuations have an <strong>impact on their decisions about reservations.</strong></li>
<li>51% of travellers around the world publish their own comments on the property after the completion of a trip.</li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Better relationships, better benefits</h2>
<p>Today, one of the key factors in the world of revenue management in hotels are relationships. <strong>We should not try to do everything on our own,</strong> it is mandatory to invest time in building strong relationships with our distribution partners, including travel agents, tour operators, consortia programs and corporate accounts. Relationships are everything, so do not hesitate to spend as much time as you need developing this important aspect of any marketing plan.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2><img class="wp-image-1149 alignleft" src="" alt="Aumentar precio medio de nuestro hotel" width="204" height="285" /></h2>
<h2>Increase the average price of our hotel Establish objectives and budgets well in advance</h2>
<p>Now is the time to set your revenue management and budget goals for next year. It is important to create the budget with enough time and try to anticipate any problems or mishaps that might occur.</p>
<p>To set the objectives and budgets in the best way, it is best <strong>to take at least the last two years as reference.</strong></p>
<p>Make sure to consider all the issues mentioned in this article and include them in your budgets, including SEO, PPC and social media strategies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Creating a revenue management culture</h2>
<p>Revenue management has many benefits for the establishment in which it is implemented. Many of these benefits are economic but not all of them.</p>
<p>For an optimal implementation of revenue management culture at a hotel or resort, <strong>it is necessary for all the staff to be involved</strong>, trained, motivated and encouraged. This culture not only helps improves the average price, but also raises commitment. In this way we will improve both the RevPar (revenue per available room) and the Trevpar (total revenue per available room). In our next article we&#8217;ll talk more in depth about revenue management.</p>
<h2>A good business plan</h2>
<p>This is the difference between marketing a hotel or applying revenue management. To summarize we&#8217;ll say that the commercial department is the one which captures the demand, while revenue management manages it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Most importantly: the quality of service</h2>
<p>If we are able to <strong>maintain high quality service standards,</strong> always encouraging a good working environment, this will positively impact on our business, and therefore on the average price. Not to mention our online and offline reputation.</p>
<p>We must not forget that <strong>we sell, especially in hotels or holiday resorts, experiences.</strong> A hotel that does not pay attention to service quality, developing a good working environment, implementing procedural standards or forming training its staff, will hardly be able to exceed customer expectations.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In this article we explained what we consider essential to improve our average price while at the same time we consolidate ourselves in the market. In this way, we will be working to improve short-term results while building a business model with good prospects in the medium and long term.</p>
<p>In our next article we will discuss the importance of good revenue management culture at a hotel or independent resort. We will then explain its benefits, as well as aspects to consider within this culture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
