<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Reasons why hotel asset and transaction manager is crucial to consider</b></span></div>
<div class=""><span class="">On account of the expanding intricacies of the present hospitality market where disruptors apparently go up all of a sudden and administrators unite at a quick rate &#8211; it is straightforward to understand why. Surely, given the instability in the movement market, numerous hotel proprietors would presently don&#8217;t face the challenge of entering a relationship with a hotel administrator without the progressing backing of a hotel asset chief. Utilized by the asset proprietor, the job of a hotel asset director is to guarantee a property arrives at its maximum capacity so it can make expanded returns in the long haul or be sold at the pinnacle of its land esteem. Following are the reasons behind choosing an expert hotel asset and transaction manager:</span></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Connectors between proprietors and administrators </b></span></div>
<div class=""><span class="">At the point when proprietors and administrators enter a hotel management arrangement, they regularly would so with different goals in care. The administrator may normally be more focused on ensuring their image and on developing their impression, while the proprietor might be taking a look at boosting their benefits or the worth of the asset. Although the management arrangement generally goes some path towards adjusting these goals, it frequently inclines somewhat more towards the administrator. This misalignment wouldn&#8217;t really be an issue if there was a more prominent evenness between the friendliness skill of the proprietor and that of the administrator. Be that as it may, enormous hotel proprietors aren&#8217;t generally proficient hoteliers. They&#8217;re bound to be monetary foundations, reserves, land organizations, high-total assets people, and so forth &#8211; frequently with minimal operational involvement with cordiality. This absence of involvement implies they may look at times battle to identify the correct administrator in any case. What&#8217;s more, in any event, when they do, they may not generally realize what to pay special mind to while arranging the best terms and conditions.</span></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Ensure communication between owner and hotel management</b></span></div>
<div class=""><span class="">Hotel asset supervisors ensure interchanges between the proprietor, the hotel management organization, and their nearby group is composed in the most effective manner. Their job is to guarantee all data &#8211; positive and negative &#8211; arrives at the possession as fast as could be expected. This makes a mutual benefit for the proprietor and the administrator. By being proactive and honest in all revealing, they ensure there are no curve balls for the possession later on. Every asset chief adopts a marginally different strategy; however, most will create a month-to-month market survey and a month-to-month benefit and misfortune audit, which features any significant issues. These reports depend on data given by the administrator, which is then normalized to make it all the more effectively absorbable for the proprietor.</span></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Resolve potential tensions</b></span></div>
<div class=""><span class="">Although the hotel asset administrators are responsible just to the asset proprietor, their job is also to fabricate spans across different groups. The individuals who become tied up with the platitude of the forceful asset chief advising administrators how to maintain their organizations will most likely be frustrated by the civility, demonstrable skill, and simplicity with which the collaborations occur. Rather than miniature overseeing senior supervisors and their chief groups, the prosperity of hotel asset and transaction managers relies upon the capacity to work cooperatively.</span></div>
<div></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Best hotel asset management practices</b></span></div>
<div class=""><span class="">The part of the asset supervisor is certainly significant for owners whose properties are under the activity of a management organization. The asset director follows up for the proprietors&#8217; advantages with a center target to enhance esteem and. In this way, it is significant for hotel asset management organizations to stay mindful of new ranges of abilities and to be outfitted with creative practices to ensure the goals of proprietors. </span></div>
<div class=""><span class="">Hotel owners will, in general, ignore freedoms to develop auxiliary incomes, and they can be deliberately coordinated with different offices in the hotel&#8217;s showcasing exercises. At this time, exclusively enhancing room income is anything but a sufficient technique over the long haul. A qualified hotel asset chief will investigate their income procedure and comprehend that it is basic to streamline income in all offices, from rooms to the spa, or some other working income streams. While it is indispensable to make a customized division technique, it is likewise essential to make esteem across any remaining working offices. Asset directors should encourage project leads to plan outlines for every division to comprehend people&#8217;s requirements and needs. For instance, besides augmenting room rates inside each section, the hotel should consider how they can urge their visitors to build consumption on different offices offered at the property.</span></div>

<div class=""><span class="">The hospitality industry is not only confined to the hotel sector, but it also incorporates services related to food, drink, theme parks, and transportation. However, we will be only focusing hotel sector from this industry, and especially it&#8217;s working in Vietnam.</span></div>
<div class=""><span class="">The hotel development in Vietnam incorporates many domestic and international brands, along with their chain hotels. However, a huge quantity among them is the homegrown brand chains or independent ones. In other words, we can say the industry is in the developing stage. Also, the international brands are located mostly at the tourist attractions in the whole country. </span></div>
<div class=""><span class="">IHCS has contributed to the development of various premiums hotels and resorts development projects in Vietnam. Following is a list of some ways IHCS is contributing:</span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Maintain a balance</b></span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">During the hotel development, one of the most important factors is to maintain a healthy balance of investment and hotel location. Being a hotel owner in Vietnam, you must remain aware of the fact that you once have to make the decisions regarding hotel size, hotel location, and amenities, and it will felt forever. Also, the major concern is the profitability factor, and it will be greatly affected by the development decisions. Therefore, one must ensure a healthy balance to increase profitability. IHCS Hotel Management &amp; Investment Company plays a significant role in this case. Being a hospitality specialist, IHCS guides the Vietnam investors within the tourists sector about the best locations in the country where different brands can develop their projects and earn handsome profit. Also, it will have a positive impact on the economy of the country. </span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Creating flexible relationships with vendors</b></span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">Vendors are the people or the companies that offer a particular thing or product for sale. For the positive growth of the hospitality industry, it is necessary to develop a flexible relationship with the vendors. You might get surprised to know that one of the largest bundles of the cost that the hotel owner gets comes from the vendors. These vendors can be companies that provide cleaning products for the hotel, or they can be your hotel&#8217;s website developers. For coping with the rapidly changing technology, it is necessary to maintain a healthy and flexible relationship with these people. IHCS has made the Vietnamese hotel industry think twice about this factor, and it is one of the major reasons behind their positive growth in this sector in such a limited duration. </span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Ensuring labor loyalty</b></span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">One of the major factors that affect hotel sector business is labor loyalty. The profitability factor gets affected by the expense of hiring the labor. Therefore, for positive development and best outcomes, it is necessary to focus on the workforce that stays loyal till the end of the project. IHCS is providing exact details about the most loyal laborers to the hotel sector in Vietnam. We will not only help in the successful completion of the hotel projects but at the same time, it will be a huge turnout for the country&#8217;s welfare. Also, the best interiors and exteriors will eventually result in increasing the tourism of the country. </span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Healthy consumer relationships</b></span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">Various feasibility studies have proved that the digital transformation of the world has completely changed the perspective of the hotel development sector. The majority of the marketing and sales details are now handled digitally. Therefore, for the best outcomes, one must install new digital systems that not only speed up the process but also help in maintaining healthy consumer relationships. IHCS is helping the hospitality sector in Vietnam in this concern. We are providing complete details regarding the newly built and functional digital systems that will make sales super fast and attract more guests than before. Also, with the help of this, the sector will be able to maintain a healthy relationship with its consumers. </span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Investment in technology</b></span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">With the rapid growth in technology, it is necessary for any business area to stay competitive. Nowadays, there is no need for the &#8220;search &amp; select hotel operators&#8221; process. Everything can be done digitally. If you keep on following the older footsteps and try to exempt the technology factor from your list while the development of hotels, then you will surely get no reward afterward. Everyone around the globe wants to enjoy the benefits of new technology, so in order to compete, you must have all the latest systems at your hotel and in your country. For the best hotel brands to visit Vietnam, IHCS has provided all the details encompassing the latest technology, its installation, and its benefits.

<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Promoting the growth of soft-brand hotels</b></span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">You must be thinking about what soft brand hotels are. Well, these are the signature hotels or the ones that are individual names and affiliated with some major national level franchise. Promoting the growth of these types of hotels will have a positive impact on the profit factor of the country that it is gaining from the hotel sector because by promoting these hotels, the country&#8217;s national franchise distribution system will also be promoted. IHCS has let the Vietnam government and tourists sector to focus on this factor for the betterment of the country. Also, these hotels have the highest occupancy rate, so it will definitely be in favor of the country in this way also. </span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Promoting customer freedom</b></span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">With the betterment of technology and society, consumers nowadays are more educated and sophisticated as compared to what they were around a decade ago. Years ago, there are very few travelers to the country that understand the differences among various hotel brands. However, it&#8217;s not the case now. As now, consumers are more knowledgeable, and they know their rights well; therefore, the best way is to provide them every type of freedom they desire. IHCS plays also a significant role in this cause for the Vietnam hotel development sector. </span></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Hotel Management Company is a firm that is determined to manage all of the daily tasks of a hotel. From making sure that the guest rooms look right to keep an eye on the daily profits, a hotel management company makes sure that everything is running smoothly.</p>
<p>Most of the people around us are unaware of the fact that the well-known hotels around the globe hire professional hotel management companies to run their business. However, the question arises, how can one believe in a particular hotel management company?

<p>The importance of having the right hotel management company can never be denied, and while thinking about the best, no one can deny the name of IHCS. Let us see in detail that what are the criteria and benefits one can get by the search and selection for the right hotel management company.</p>
<p><b>IHCS guide on selecting the right hotel management company</b></p>
<p>According to our experts, the following are the guidelines that one must focus on selecting the right hotel management company:</p>
<p><b>Maintain a competitive environment</b></p>
<p>Proprietors frequently fall for the principal management company they meet. They get welcome to visit the company&#8217;s most pleasant property, remain in a beautiful suite, appreciate a decent supper with the chiefs of the company, and, then before they know it, they feel submitted. Shockingly, management organizations are not equivalent, and management contract terms can change drastically. Establishing a serious climate from the beginning will compel the director to arrange an ideal arrangement and result in a more positive result for the proprietor. The most widely recognized technique to establish a competition is through the proposal process.</p>
<p><b>Get help from the right advisor</b></p>
<p>Hotels are working organizations, and the connection between proprietor and administrator is not a simple subject to handle. Most management organizations have broad experience in management arrangements and use both in-house and outside direction. Proprietorship ought to be correspondingly spoken to by specialists. All proprietors ought to be spoken to by specialists that have practical experience in hotel management arrangements.</p>
<p>Proprietors or owners with restricted involvement with hotel management choice additionally should enlist an accomplished hotel resource director to help them through the cycle and to work with management on a continuous premise to boost the estimation of the hotel. In the selection process of management, the advisor will assist the owners with clarifying objectives and, subsequently, give suggestions with respect to the best management company for the hotel.</p>
<p><b>Explain your objectives</b></p>
<p>Maximizing the estimation is ordinarily the owner&#8217;s essential objective and is the reason for most choices. However, boosting isn&#8217;t as basic as it appears. An engineer constructing a full-administration hotel in a high boundary to-section metropolitan market may be best served by keeping the hotel autonomous. However, additionally, it could be a genuinely dangerous technique. Different hotel owners are not propelled by the productivity of their hotels yet are more worried about the effect of the hotel on other factors. For instance, schools and colleges regularly are more worried about securing their relationship with the network and their image picture than with the main concern benefit. Whatever the objective, understanding the objectives is a significant factor to consider while choosing a management company.</p>
<p><b>Understand your hotel</b></p>
<p>Each hotel is special. Many offer similar features, yet none are equivalent. Hotels are not just a component of their room check and actual item; they likewise are characterized by their area, the interest on the lookout, and their opposition. Sharp owners will have a careful comprehension of their hotel whether or not it&#8217;s a current property or new development. Moreover, ownership ought to have a decent comprehension of the hotel&#8217;s capital requirements and extended money related execution. In conclusion, understanding the hotel&#8217;s attractive quality to administrators is necessary.</p>
<p>After the hotel owners have focused on all of the four above-mentioned factors, the next step is to hire a company that seems suitable for their business based on the results of these factors prescribed by IHCS.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>WEIGHING AND ANALYZING THE VIABILITY OF A HOTEL ESTABLISHMENT ARE TWO OF THE KEYS TO DETERMINE THE SUCCESS OF SUCH INVESTMENT. THAT IS WHY IT IS SO IMPORTANT TO MAKE A CORRECT JUSTIFICATION OF A HOTEL PROJECT IF YOU WANT TO FIND QUALITY INVESTORS TO MAKE YOUR IDEA A REALITY.</p>
<p>Weighing and analyzing the viability of a hotel establishment are two of the keys to determining this investment&#8217;s success. That is why it is essential to correctly justify a hotel project if you want to find quality investors to make your idea come true.</p>
<p><b>STEPS FOR THE JUSTIFICATION OF A HOTEL PROJECT</b></p>
<p>To develop a hotel project, it is essential to previously prepare a report capable of justifying its creation and future viability. At IHCS, we have extensive experience advising and guiding entrepreneurs worldwide when starting their hotel projects.</p>
<p><b>INITIAL MARKET ANALYSIS</b></p>
<p>Betting on the development of a hotel establishment in Spain is always a long-term investment with ample success guarantees. All this is because it is a country where tourism constitutes an integral part of its GDP. According to data from the latest analysis of the Statista portal, in 2019, hotel investment exceeded 2,500 million euros.</p>
<p>In this way, we found that when it comes to justifying a hotel project, choosing Spain as the establishment&#8217;s location is a plus.</p>
<p><b>INTERNATIONAL TOURISM CHOOSES HOTEL ESTABLISHMENTS</b></p>
<p>Is it viable to bet on a hotel project in Spain? The numbers speak for themselves. In 2019, a year marked by the emergence and growth of tourist housing &#8211; the main competitor of hotel establishments &#8211; hotel occupancy exceeded 70% in all hotels throughout the country.</p>
<p><b>HOTEL PROFILE AS A PROJECT</b></p>
<p>It is also important to decide what type of hotel establishment you want to develop. The needs of a five-star resort will not be the same as that of a rural hotel. At IHCS, we are always committed to carrying out a detailed analysis of the profile sought with its defining characteristics.</p>
<p>According to statistical studies, foreign tourists tend to opt for four-star hotels, where the average number of overnight stays is 3.2 days. Considering the place where the hotel project will be established, it will be essential to determine what type of tourists are expected to adapt the facilities to a more splendid reception.</p>
<p><b>DEFINITION OF THE PRODUCT AND ITS SERVICES</b></p>
<p>After making the hotel profile that you want to develop, the next step will be to define it completely. Size, number of rooms, facilities, terrain, the architectural and decorative style would be framed at this point &#8230;</p>
<p>But it will also be necessary to make a list where the services you want to offer in the said establishment are reflected. Differentiating from the hotel offers can be an advantage for specific audiences. For example, offering pet-friendly services may come across as a convenience for some families. Also, determine if it will be an exclusive access hotel for families without children can attract a specific public. Each project will have to bet on a particular strength.</p>
<p>Finally, the rates will also be an important determining factor for guests. Carrying out a market study will be easy to see which margins are best suited to the project according to its benefits.</p>
<p>Investors will want to find in the justification of a hotel project absolutely everything that will define the establishment.</p>
<p><b>COMMERCIAL AND MARKETING STRATEGY</b></p>
<p>Today a project is nothing without a good plan of action to facilitate its commercialization. In this section, communication and marketing come into play, disciplines capable of marking a before and after in your project&#8217;s success. Thus, in the justification of a hotel project, it is recommended to include an action plan detailing the strategies to follow to achieve different objectives, mostly financial.</p>
<p><b>LET YOURSELF HELP FOR THE JUSTIFICATION PROCESS OF A HOTEL PROJECT</b></p>
<p>Justifying a hotel&#8217;s creation can become a tedious process if you do not have the necessary knowledge and experience in the sector. That is why at IHCS, we offer you our advisory services for the development of hotel projects.</p>
<p>We will make sure to offer you the best services so that you can optimize your resources as much as possible and get the financing you want with different hotel investors.</p>
<p>Our extensive experience will help us to adapt to any hotel project. Whatever the concept, we will try to adjust our strategies as much as possible so that you make it a reality and make it a benchmark in the international hotel sector.</p>
<p>We want you to grow by our side, so do not hesitate to consult our hotel project development services. Get in touch with us, and we will study your case in detail!.</p>
