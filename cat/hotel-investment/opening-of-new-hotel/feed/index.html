<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Reasons why hotel asset and transaction manager is crucial to consider</b></span></div>
<div class=""><span class="">On account of the expanding intricacies of the present hospitality market where disruptors apparently go up all of a sudden and administrators unite at a quick rate &#8211; it is straightforward to understand why. Surely, given the instability in the movement market, numerous hotel proprietors would presently don&#8217;t face the challenge of entering a relationship with a hotel administrator without the progressing backing of a hotel asset chief. Utilized by the asset proprietor, the job of a hotel asset director is to guarantee a property arrives at its maximum capacity so it can make expanded returns in the long haul or be sold at the pinnacle of its land esteem. Following are the reasons behind choosing an expert hotel asset and transaction manager:</span></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Connectors between proprietors and administrators </b></span></div>
<div class=""><span class="">At the point when proprietors and administrators enter a hotel management arrangement, they regularly would so with different goals in care. The administrator may normally be more focused on ensuring their image and on developing their impression, while the proprietor might be taking a look at boosting their benefits or the worth of the asset. Although the management arrangement generally goes some path towards adjusting these goals, it frequently inclines somewhat more towards the administrator. This misalignment wouldn&#8217;t really be an issue if there was a more prominent evenness between the friendliness skill of the proprietor and that of the administrator. Be that as it may, enormous hotel proprietors aren&#8217;t generally proficient hoteliers. They&#8217;re bound to be monetary foundations, reserves, land organizations, high-total assets people, and so forth &#8211; frequently with minimal operational involvement with cordiality. This absence of involvement implies they may look at times battle to identify the correct administrator in any case. What&#8217;s more, in any event, when they do, they may not generally realize what to pay special mind to while arranging the best terms and conditions.</span></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Ensure communication between owner and hotel management</b></span></div>
<div class=""><span class="">Hotel asset supervisors ensure interchanges between the proprietor, the hotel management organization, and their nearby group is composed in the most effective manner. Their job is to guarantee all data &#8211; positive and negative &#8211; arrives at the possession as fast as could be expected. This makes a mutual benefit for the proprietor and the administrator. By being proactive and honest in all revealing, they ensure there are no curve balls for the possession later on. Every asset chief adopts a marginally different strategy; however, most will create a month-to-month market survey and a month-to-month benefit and misfortune audit, which features any significant issues. These reports depend on data given by the administrator, which is then normalized to make it all the more effectively absorbable for the proprietor.</span></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Resolve potential tensions</b></span></div>
<div class=""><span class="">Although the hotel asset administrators are responsible just to the asset proprietor, their job is also to fabricate spans across different groups. The individuals who become tied up with the platitude of the forceful asset chief advising administrators how to maintain their organizations will most likely be frustrated by the civility, demonstrable skill, and simplicity with which the collaborations occur. Rather than miniature overseeing senior supervisors and their chief groups, the prosperity of hotel asset and transaction managers relies upon the capacity to work cooperatively.</span></div>
<div></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Best hotel asset management practices</b></span></div>
<div class=""><span class="">The part of the asset supervisor is certainly significant for owners whose properties are under the activity of a management organization. The asset director follows up for the proprietors&#8217; advantages with a center target to enhance esteem and. In this way, it is significant for hotel asset management organizations to stay mindful of new ranges of abilities and to be outfitted with creative practices to ensure the goals of proprietors. </span></div>
<div class=""><span class="">Hotel owners will, in general, ignore freedoms to develop auxiliary incomes, and they can be deliberately coordinated with different offices in the hotel&#8217;s showcasing exercises. At this time, exclusively enhancing room income is anything but a sufficient technique over the long haul. A qualified hotel asset chief will investigate their income procedure and comprehend that it is basic to streamline income in all offices, from rooms to the spa, or some other working income streams. While it is indispensable to make a customized division technique, it is likewise essential to make esteem across any remaining working offices. Asset directors should encourage project leads to plan outlines for every division to comprehend people&#8217;s requirements and needs. For instance, besides augmenting room rates inside each section, the hotel should consider how they can urge their visitors to build consumption on different offices offered at the property.</span></div>

<div class=""><span class="">The hospitality industry is not only confined to the hotel sector, but it also incorporates services related to food, drink, theme parks, and transportation. However, we will be only focusing hotel sector from this industry, and especially it&#8217;s working in Vietnam.</span></div>
<div class=""><span class="">The hotel development in Vietnam incorporates many domestic and international brands, along with their chain hotels.

<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">Vendors are the people or the companies that offer a particular thing or product for sale. For the positive growth of the hospitality industry, it is necessary to develop a flexible relationship with the vendors. You might get surprised to know that one of the largest bundles of the cost that the hotel owner gets comes from the vendors. These vendors can be companies that provide cleaning products for the hotel, or they can be your hotel&#8217;s website developers. For coping with the rapidly changing technology, it is necessary to maintain a healthy and flexible relationship with these people. IHCS has made the Vietnamese hotel industry think twice about this factor, and it is one of the major reasons behind their positive growth in this sector in such a limited duration. </span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Ensuring labor loyalty</b></span></div>
<div class=""></div>

<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Healthy consumer relationships</b></span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">Various feasibility studies have proved that the digital transformation of the world has completely changed the perspective of the hotel development sector. The majority of the marketing and sales details are now handled digitally. Therefore, for the best outcomes, one must install new digital systems that not only speed up the process but also help in maintaining healthy consumer relationships.

<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Investment in technology</b></span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">With the rapid growth in technology, it is necessary for any business area to stay competitive. Nowadays, there is no need for the &#8220;search &amp; select hotel operators&#8221; process. Everything can be done digitally. If you keep on following the older footsteps and try to exempt the technology factor from your list while the development of hotels, then you will surely get no reward afterward. Everyone around the globe wants to enjoy the benefits of new technology, so in order to compete, you must have all the latest systems at your hotel and in your country.

<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Promoting the growth of soft-brand hotels</b></span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">You must be thinking about what soft brand hotels are. Well, these are the signature hotels or the ones that are individual names and affiliated with some major national level franchise. Promoting the growth of these types of hotels will have a positive impact on the profit factor of the country that it is gaining from the hotel sector because by promoting these hotels, the country&#8217;s national franchise distribution system will also be promoted. IHCS has let the Vietnam government and tourists sector to focus on this factor for the betterment of the country. Also, these hotels have the highest occupancy rate, so it will definitely be in favor of the country in this way also. </span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class=""><b class="">Promoting customer freedom</b></span></div>
<div class=""></div>
<div class=""><span class="">With the betterment of technology and society, consumers nowadays are more educated and sophisticated as compared to what they were around a decade ago. Years ago, there are very few travelers to the country that understand the differences among various hotel brands. However, it&#8217;s not the case now. As now, consumers are more knowledgeable, and they know their rights well; therefore, the best way is to provide them every type of freedom they desire. IHCS plays also a significant role in this cause for the Vietnam hotel development sector. </span></div>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>ADAPTATION TO THE DIVERSITY OF PAYMENT MEANS HAS BECOME A SUBJECT OF HUGE IMPORTANCE IN HOTEL MANAGEMENT. THE EVOLUTION OF THE SECTOR CALLS FOR THE PROGRESSIVE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES FOR THE START-UP AND OPTIMISATION OF CASHLESS PAYMENT, OR CASHLESS PAYMENT, AS THE MOST INNOVATIVE, QUICK AND ACCORDING TO NEW CUSTOMER DEMANDS.</p>
<p><strong>WHAT IS CASHLESS? DEFINITION</strong></p>
<p>The cashless system, currently widespread in major events (concerts, fairs, amusement parks, festivals, etc.) consists of a cashless payment system with a virtual mode (mobile phone, digital watch, rechargeable wristbands) its virtual currency and through the so-called NFC technology.</p>
<p>This NFC (Near Field Communication) platform is a wireless communication system designed to communicate two technological devices at a short distance.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>This platform, which does not necessarily have to be connected to the internet, allows the collection and exchange of data and making payments through our mobile phone and, consequently, the reduction of cash.</p>
<p>In a changing society, the accommodation industry should integrate these new forms of economic transactions in hotel companies: New customers, new payment systems, which provide a series of advantages that we can see below.</p>
<p><strong>THE CASHLESS SYSTEM: ADVANTAGES FOR THE HOTEL</strong></p>
<p>The implementation of the cashless system in the hotel sector seems unstoppable. The generalisation of cashless payment marks more than just the hotel transaction system&#8217;s modernisation between hotel and customer. And it brings with it a series of benefits, which will improve staff management and, above all, the customer experience.</p>
<p><strong>OCCUPATION AND BRAND REINFORCEMENT</strong></p>
<p>The implementation of new payment systems leads to an increase in hotel occupancy and profits. The customer is motivated to consume hotel services almost on impulse, favored by the service&#8217;s greater agility.</p>
<p>This system also reverts to the benefit of the hotel and its publicity. You will reinforce your brand by participating in a new experiential way.</p>
<p><strong>MARKETING TOOL</strong></p>
<p>From the arrival of the client, at the time of check-in, the hotel will be able to obtain a lot of information in a simple way, such as what type of traveler consumes more or what is the hotel&#8217;s most requested product or what is its expense according to its origin.</p>
<p>It will be a significant information source for the occupancy metrics or establishment records and, consequently, optimize your results. The data collected in the system will allow you to carry out promotions tailored to your customers&#8217; demands.</p>
<p><strong>SECURITY</strong></p>
<p>The risk of loss or fraud is reduced by eliminating physical transactions and not operating with cash. Security expenses are also significantly reduced by requiring up to 10 times fewer security personnel to transport funds.<span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span></p>
<p>In this sense, NFC technology offers another significant advantage: it does not need specific readers. Any mobile phone with NFC and the necessary application allows us to implement the system with all the security protocols&#8217; requirements.</p>
<p><strong>LOYALTY</strong></p>
<p>The greater variety and evolution of payment systems guarantee the highest customer satisfaction level after their stay at the hotel. This is one of the indicators of loyalty with a specific hotel brand.</p>
<p><strong>CUSTOMER ACCESS CONTROL</strong></p>
<p>Those responsible for the common areas (dining room, lobby bar&#8230;) will carry out a complete control of the clients&#8217; access to particular hotel facilities.</p>
<p><strong>THE CASHLESS SYSTEM: ADVANTAGES FOR THE GUEST</strong></p>
<p>The news in the tourism and hotel sector shows that the traveler&#8217;s trends or lead to integrate into the experiential demand. The client pays for a good hotel, but he wants to feel part of what happens at his destination. The new payment methods become part of that experience and bring a series of advantages to the customer.</p>
<p>Staff training and the implementation of new technologies in the sector are the two factors that greatly facilitate the relationship between client and hotel. The new payment methods become part of that experience and provide a series of advantages to the guest.</p>
<p><strong>PAYMENT WITHOUT CASH</strong></p>
<p>It is the fundamental change concerning the current predominant mode of payment through the POS card. When making your purchase, the customer will bring his bracelet to the waiter&#8217;s mobile phone, and the cashless system will allow his consumption to be paid with the cashless system. Drinks can be paid even from the pool, which will provide a lot of autonomy for both the hotel staff and the guest.</p>
<p><strong>ROOM OPENING</strong></p>
<p>Keys and magnetic cards will become part of history. Through NFC technology, the customer can access the room safely and quickly. Through your mobile or bracelet.</p>
<p><strong>RESERVATIONS OF SERVICES AND ACTIVITIES</strong></p>
<p>The client may, for example, make the reservation of activities, excursions, provide a wi-fi connection or access to restricted areas such as gym, spa, or conference rooms, or cost control for minors with the so-called kid-limit.</p>
<p><strong>ACCUMULATED EXPENSE</strong></p>
<p>The guests may accumulate expenses that will be paid at the end of the stay. They will be able to see their movements and download their final invoice at the time of their departure.</p>
<p>The evolution of the hotel sector replaces modernization and sets the pace according to customer demands and social changes. The definitive settlement of digitization is no longer a pending issue.</p>
<p>From<strong> IHCS</strong>, as an international hotel consultancy, we can provide you with the necessary support for staff training and the exemplary implementation of the digital system and the implementation of new management systems in your establishment.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From conception to putting your ideas to reality and finally ribbon-cutting, the process of developing, running, and managing a hotel demands <b>thoughtful planning and a clear vision.</b> There is not even a single hotel success story without planning, expenses, and some <b>blood, sweat, and tears.</b> Our goal, of course, is to help you manage those hotel investments and expenses by investing in the right things at the right times.</p>
<p>A pre-opening budget, or POB, is a detailed document that reflects anticipated expenses associated with the hospitality industry. It covers everything ranging from major operational activities required to prepare for a hotel’s opening, to minor pre-opening expenses.</p>
<p>If you have decided to open a new hotel and make a hotel investment, it is imperative to understand beforehand, how much will it cost you and what all expenses will you have to face. Among other services, we will help you implement strategies to manage all the expenses and <b>turn your hotel dream into a success story. </b></p>
<p><b>What does a pre-opening budget include?</b></p>
<p>At IHCS, we are a team of experts in developing and managing a pre-opening budget for your hotel. Avail our services and steer yourself towards the right decisions. <b>Here are a few things to include in your preliminary pre-opening budget.</b></p>
<ul>
<li>Hotel pre-opening expenses.</li>
<li>Executive hiring and relocation expenses.</li>
<li>Staff recruiting and training expenses.</li>
<li>Marketing and advertising expenses.</li>
<li>Regulatory expenses.</li>
<li>Temporary office space and equipment expenses.</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Reasons to have a pre-opening budget:</b></p>
<p>Regardless of the idea and approach of your hotel, you need to think of the process in a few distinct parts and all the components should be part of the preopening budget. This is why you should have a pre-opening budget.</p>
<p><b>A benchmark for future expansion:</b></p>
<p>Having a pre-opening budget before opening a new hotel, allow you to get a fair idea of what it costs to open and run a new location. In addition to that, it offers an excellent benchmark for the future expansion of your hotel.</p>
<p><b>A tool to measure performance:</b></p>
<p>The development and success of a hotel demand a commitment of capital by the owner if he expects a potential profit. A pre-opening budget will assist you with internal analytics and comparisons used to measure performance, to ensure a return on the investment.</p>
<p><b>Increases predictability:</b></p>
<p>A Hotel constructed with thoughtful planning, close coordination, and good budget control will have predictable costs in the future for maintenance, operation, and renovation.</p>
<p><b>What do we offer?</b></p>
<p>At IHCS, we not only assist you to develop a pre-opening budget for your hotel project but also help you <b>critically assess and re-evaluate</b> it against the market realities to <b>mitigate potential cost issues</b>. We offer you close coordination with our experts to <b>make strategic decisions</b> and monitor the pre-opening budget against anticipated costs. IHCS also seeks to offer ways to ensure that overruns in certain departments do not detract the hotel management from the expenditures that are critical to the future performance of your hotel.</p>
