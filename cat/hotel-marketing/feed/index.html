										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In the hospitality market, owners, brands, management companies, and investors seek help to improve operating performance while enhancing profitability. Hotels without a proper entrance and exit strategy and a strong decision-making approach tend to fail as a success story. Such hotels start losing occupancy points and further narrow the market segment. This is where it becomes imperative to consult an expert hotel consulting company to improve organizational communications, customer satisfaction, employee motivation, and work performance.</p>
<p>At IHCS, we give expert advice on hotel management and provide you with ways to fill the gaps between desired and actual results. We are more than just a hotel consultant company that not only designs your hotel’s goals and missions but also helps implement those strategies while working alongside your team. In a nutshell, a hotel consultant helps you live your hotel dream!</p>
<p>Let us delve into the details and discuss the important responsibilities and roles of a hotel consultant company.</p>
<p>Help design the strategy that best suits your business:</p>
<p>An expert hotel consulting company empowers your business by designing a customized entrance and exit strategy that fits perfectly to your business profile. If you are planning to expand your business or starting from scratch, it is crucial to consult a team that provides you with information and tools to make the best decisions for such a move. As a hotel consultant is an expert in the field with the appropriate knowledge, he chooses the most suitable technology based on the type of your hotel and its needs.</p>
<p>Adaptation to the market:</p>
<p>With the ever-changing economic environment and market trends, you need to act proactively as a business owner. When it comes to hotel marketing and hotel project development, there is a dire need to shape your decisions that best adapt to the market trends. For this purpose, you need to consult a hotel consulting company that considers consumer travel intent and make <b>real-time choices about hotels and rates</b>.</p>
<p>Financial evaluation to enhance profitability:</p>
<p>Being in charge of your hotel&#8217;s viability, a hotel consultant helps you determine the reliability of your project, whether it makes financial sense or will drain your resources. This helps make calculated decisions to enhance profitability. A hotel consulting company offers ways to manage finances, prices of services, appropriate staff hiring, and payment of taxes, all that translates into increased profitability.</p>
<p>Devise a solid marketing plan:</p>
<p>For new hoteliers, it is equally necessary to design a marketing plan to let the world know about your hotel. With experience and expertise, a hotel consulting company offers a well-defined marketing plan to increase direct bookings and capture customers. Given the importance of the internet and social media, a hotel consulting company uses its knowledge to extend the brand throughout the network.</p>
<p>THE FINAL VERDICT:</p>
<p>To conclude, a hotel consultant excels in giving expert advice on hotel investments, asset management, and everything under the umbrella of the hospitality industry. An expert hotel consulting company not only helps with marketing and management goals but also deals at the employee end by helping with training, guiding, and coaching the staff. Hence, from creating a hotel marketing plan to designing an operational strategy, an expert hotel consultant has all the bases covered.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The hotel sector has known how to keep up with the times and the trends set by the public, adapting to their tastes and preferences and attempting to attract more clients by offering unique services.</p>
<p><strong>ELEMENTS OF ONLINE HOTEL MARKETING</strong></p>
<p><strong>SEO POSITIONING</strong></p>
<p>To reach a client, it&#8217;s necessary that your hotel has a good website and to take into account a very powerful tool: SEO. It&#8217;s one of the most robust tools for driving traffic to the website.   Its strong point is that after its initial implementation, it continues to generate revenue and its results last throughout time. Hiring a <a href="https://emaximize.com/">top digital marketing agency in los angeles</a> can make sure that your website is SEO optimized. </p>
<p><strong>SOCIAL NETWORKS</strong></p>
<p>Social networks are a very appealing channel of communication between clients and the hotel because they bring significant traffic, thanks to their reach.</p>
<p><strong>EMAIL MARKETING</strong></p>
<p>Hotels&#8217; databases allow for different actions to be taken to advertise promotions and promote client loyalty, which can be done through the practice of <a href="https://us.epsilon.com/epsilon-peoplecloud-overview/messaging">email marketing</a>. The more data we have on our clients, the more specific and effective the segmentation of our audience will be.</p>
<p><strong>ONLINE ADVERTISING</strong></p>
<p>Creating paid campaigns is a fundamental technique for gaining exposure, directing quality traffic to the website, and converting it into direct reservations. An example of this is the campaign conducted by the Hilton chain. It tried to communicate to users what they defined as &#8220;Feel the Hamptonality&#8221; through a series of videos considered to be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCJwyZTdBTSNQr86tHnTvZFA">&#8220;Hampton Moments&#8221;</a>, in which they told real client experiences.</p>
<p><strong>CHANGES IN MARKETING STRATEGY</strong></p>
<p>The growth of the competition is noted both in the growing number of hotel companies and establishments and in the incorporation of new tourist destinations. This causes greater pressure from tour operators. Faced with this, companies must respond by expanding the offer of services with greater added value. The increase in bargaining power of tour operators and travel agencies can be seen as a consequence of the business integration and concentration they are undergoing.</p>
<p>Traditionally, the intermediaries, as direct interlocutors with the end clients, have always been the ones who know the market best. The hotel may have been able to know its clients&#8217; preferences and needs once they arrived, but it did not have many opportunities to learn about the general characteristics of the potential demands of the market.</p>
<p><strong>HOTEL MARKETING &#8211; NEW TECHNOLOGY</strong></p>
<p>New technology is an extraordinary help to the hotel in achieving this result. The internet is a fundamental channel for communication and management of clients&#8217; relationships with the hotel, given that it offers the possibility of directly improving the hotels&#8217; knowledge in this regard.</p>
<p>Through direct online sales, it is possible to obtain data that expands the hotel&#8217;s knowledge of its clients&#8217; tastes and preferences.</p>
<p>The integration of data acquired via the internet into the hotel&#8217;s CRM (Customer Relationship Management, the management of a company&#8217;s business relationship with its clients) allows for, amongst other things, grouping different clients into segments and providing them with personalized offers.</p>
<p>In addition to learning the preferences and tastes of a hotel&#8217;s clients, it is very important to know the value of each client. A meticulous and organized use of the data allows for the average expenditure per client to be determined, a key piece of information when it comes to deciding the best type of <a href="https://www.sheerid.com/business/resources/personalized_marketing_communication_and_promotion/">personalized marketing</a> action to take for each of them.</p>
<p>New technology, in which the internet plays a very important role, also allows us to know what to offer the client before, during, and after their stay. In addition, it can help the hotel to improve the client&#8217;s overall experience through the introduction of new services such as electronic check-in, sending personalized information, and more.</p>
<p>In short, we can affirm that technology allows for the general perception of the hotel&#8217;s brand image and its revenue to be improved.</p>
